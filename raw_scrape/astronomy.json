"For the past fifty years of space exploration, mass spectrometry has provided unique chemical and physical insights on the characteristics of other planetary bodies in the Solar System. A variety of mass spectrometer types, including magnetic sector, quadrupole, time-of-flight, and ion trap, have and will continue to deepen our understanding of the formation and evolution of exploration targets like the surfaces and atmospheres of planets and their moons. An important impetus for the continuing exploration of Mars, Europa, Enceladus, Titan, and Venus involves assessing the habitability of solar system bodies and, ultimately, the search for life\u2014a monumental effort that can be advanced by mass spectrometry. Modern flight-capable mass spectrometers, in combination with various sample processing, separation, and ionization techniques enable sensitive detection of chemical biosignatures. While our canonical knowledge of biosignatures is rooted in Terran-based examples, agnostic approaches in astrobiology can cast a wider net, to search for signs of life that may not be based on Terran-like biochemistry. Here, we delve into the search for extraterrestrial chemical and morphological biosignatures and examine several possible approaches to agnostic life detection using mass spectrometry. We discuss how future missions can help ensure that our search strategies are inclusive of unfamiliar life forms.",
"Context. The formation mechanisms of stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary companions, their dependencies on the environment and their interactions with each other are still not well established. Recently, combining high-contrast imaging and space astrometry we found that Jupiter-like (JL) planets are frequent in the \u03b2 Pic moving group (BPMG) around those stars where their orbit can be stable, prompting further analysis and discussion.Aims. We broaden our previous analysis to other young nearby associations to determine the frequency, mass and separation of companions in general and JL in particular and their dependencies on the mass and age of the associations.Methods. We collected available data about companions to the stars in the BPMG and seven additional young associations, including those revealed by visual observations, eclipses, spectroscopy and astrometry.Results. We determined search completeness and found that it is very high for stellar companions, while completeness corrections are still large for JL companions. Once these corrections are included, we found a high frequency of companions, both stellar (>0.52 \u00b1 0.03) and JL (0.57 \u00b1 0.11). The two populations are clearly separated by a gap that corresponds to the well-known brown dwarf desert. Within the population of massive companions, we found clear trends in frequency, separation, and mass ratios with stellar mass. Planetary companions pile up in the region just outside the ice line and we found them to be frequent once completeness was considered. The frequency of JL planets decreases with the overall mass and possibly the age of the association.Conclusions. We tentatively identify the two populations as due to disk fragmentation and core accretion, respectively. The distributions of stellar companions with a semi-major axis <1000 au is indeed well reproduced by a simple model of formation by disk fragmentation. The observed trends with stellar mass can be explained by a shorter but much more intense phase of accretion onto the disk of massive stars and by a more steady and prolonged accretion on solar-type stars. Possible explanations for the trends in the population of JL planets with association mass and age are briefly discussed.",
"Context. Small planets located at the lower mode of the bimodal radius distribution are generally assumed to be composed of iron and silicates in a proportion similar to that of the Earth. However, recent discoveries are revealing a new group of low-density planets that are inconsistent with that description.Aims. We intend to confirm and characterize the TESS planet candidate TOI-244.01, which orbits the bright (K = 7.97 mag), nearby (d = 22 pc), and early-type (M2.5 V) M-dwarf star GJ 1018 with an orbital period of 7.4 days.Methods. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to model 57 precise radial velocity measurements acquired by the ESPRESSO spectrograph together with TESS photometry and complementary HARPS data. Our model includes a planetary component and Gaussian processes aimed at modeling the correlated stellar and instrumental noise.Results. We find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a radius of Rp = 1.52 \u00b1 0.12 R\u2295 and a mass of Mp = 2.68 \u00b1 0.30 M\u2295. These values correspond to a density of \u03c1 = 4.2 \u00b1 1.1 g cm\u22123, which is below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition. We find that atmospheric loss processes may have been efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained. Our internal structure modeling suggests that TOI-244 b has a 479\u221296+128 km thick hydrosphere over a 1.17 \u00b1 0.09 R\u2295 solid structure composed of a Fe-rich core and a silicate-dominated mantle compatible with that of the Earth. On a population level, we find two tentative trends in the density-metallicity and density-insolation parameter space for the low-density super-Earths, which may hint at their composition.Conclusions. With a 8% precision in radius and 12% precision in mass, TOI-244 b is among the most precisely characterized super-Earths, which, together with the likely presence of an extended hydrosphere, makes it a key target for atmospheric observations.",
"We identify stellar structures in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby galaxies and construct morphological masks of sub-galactic environments based on Spitzer 3.6\u2006\u03bcm images. At the simplest level, we distinguish five environments: centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm regions, and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, which are publicly released but not explicitly used in this paper. We examine trends with environment in the molecular gas content, star formation rate, and depletion time using PHANGS\u2013ALMA CO(2\u20131) intensity maps and tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals clearly dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the molecular Kennicutt\u2013Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties and without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to what has been suggested by early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments. Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 We review the research on a wide variety of topics using data obtained with the 200-inch Hale telescope. Using state-of-the-art spectrographs, photometers, spectrometers and infrared detectors, the Palomar astronomers investigated the spectra of stars, interstellar matter, AGNs and quasars in great detail. Spectral resolutions ranged from 1000 A for broad-band photometry to 0.04 A using interferometric techniques. ",
"Over the years, numerous attempts have been made to connect the phenomenology and physics of mass accretion onto stellar-mass and super-massive black holes in a scale-invariant fashion. In this paper, we explore this connection at the radiatively efficient (and non-jetted) end of accretion modes by comparing the relationship between the luminosity of the accretion disc and corona in the two source classes. Motivated by the apparently tight relationship between these two quantities in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we analyse 458 RXTE-PCA archival observations of the X-ray binary (XRB) GX 339\u20134, using this object as an exemplar for the properties of XRBs in general. We focus on the soft and soft-intermediate states, which have been suggested to be analogous to radiatively efficient AGNs. The observed scatter in the logLdisc\u2005\u2212\u2005logLcoronarelationship of GX 339\u20134 is high (\u223c0.43 dex) and significantly larger than in a representative sample of radiatively efficient, non- or weakly jetted AGNs (\u223c0.30 dex). At first glance, this would appear contrary to the hypothesis that the systems simply scale with mass. On the other hand, we also find that GX 339\u20134 and our AGN sample show different accretion rate and power-law index distributions, with the latter in particular being broader in GX 339\u20134 (dispersion of \u223c0.16 cf. \u223c0.08 for AGN). GX 339\u20134 also shows an overall softer slope, with a mean value of \u223c2.20 as opposed to \u223c2.07 for the AGN sample. Remarkably, once similarly broad \u0393 and\u1e41distributions are selected, the AGN sample overlaps nicely with GX 339\u20134 observations in the mass-normalised logLdisc\u2005\u2212\u2005logLcoronaplane, with a scatter of \u223c0.30\u2005\u2212\u20050.33 dex in both cases. This indicates that a mass-scaling of properties might hold after all, with our results being consistent with the disc-corona systems in AGNs and XRBs exhibiting the same physical processes, albeit under different conditions for instance in terms of temperature, optical depth and/or electron energy distribution in the corona, heating-cooling balance, coronal geometry and/or black hole spin.",
"Context. The analysis of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) environments can provide important information on the life cycle of massive stars and constrain the progenitor properties of these powerful explosions. The MUSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) enables detailed local environment constraints of the progenitors of large samples of CCSNe. Using a homogeneous SN sample from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) survey, an untargeted and spectroscopically complete transient survey, has enabled us to perform a minimally biased statistical analysis of CCSN environments.Aims. We analyze 111 galaxies observed by MUSE that hosted 112 CCSNe \u2013 78 II, nine IIn, seven IIb, four Ic, seven Ib, three Ibn, two Ic-BL, one ambiguous Ibc, and one superluminous SN \u2013 detected or discovered by the ASAS-SN survey between 2014 and 2018. The majority of the galaxies were observed by the All-weather MUse Supernova Integral field Nearby Galaxies (AMUSING) survey. Here we analyze the immediate environment around the SN locations and compare the properties between the different CCSN types and their light curves.Methods. We used stellar population synthesis and spectral fitting techniques to derive physical parameters for all H\u202fII regions detected within each galaxy, including the star formation rate (SFR), H\u03b1 equivalent width (EW), oxygen abundance, and extinction.Results. We found that stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) occur in environments with a higher median SFR, H\u03b1 EW, and oxygen abundances than SNe II and SNe IIn/Ibn. Most of the distributions have no statistically significant differences, except between oxygen abundance distributions of SESNe and SNe II, and between H\u03b1 EW distributions of SESNe and SNe II. The distributions of SNe II and IIn are very similar, indicating that these events explode in similar environments. For the SESNe, SNe Ic have higher median SFRs, H\u03b1 EWs, and oxygen abundances than SNe Ib. SNe IIb have environments with similar SFRs and H\u03b1 EWs to SNe Ib, and similar oxygen abundances to SNe Ic. We also show that the postmaximum decline rate, s, of SNe II correlates with the H\u03b1 EW, and that the luminosity and the \u0394m15 parameter of SESNe correlate with the oxygen abundance, H\u03b1 EW, and SFR at their environments. This suggests a connection between the explosion mechanisms of these events to their environment properties.",
"Context. Galaxy-wide outflows driven by star formation and/or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) are thought to play a crucial rule in the evolution of galaxies and the metal enrichment of the inter-galactic medium. Direct measurements of these processes are still scarce and new observations are needed to reveal the nature of outflows in the majority of the galaxy population.Aims. We combine extensive, spatially-resolved, multi-wavelength observations, taken as part of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS), for the edge-on disc galaxy HE 1353\u22121917 in order to characterise the impact of the AGN on its host galaxy via outflows and radiation.Methods. Multi-color broad-band photometry was combined with spatially-resolved optical, near-infrared (NIR) and sub-mm and radio observations taken with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopy Explorer (MUSE), the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS), the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and theKarl G. JanskyVery Large Array (VLA) to map the physical properties and kinematics of the multi-phase interstellar medium.Results. We detect a biconical extended narrow-line region ionised by the luminous AGN orientated nearly parallel to the galaxy disc, extending out to at least 25 kpc. The extra-planar gas originates from galactic fountains initiated by star formation processes in the disc, rather than an AGN outflow, as shown by the kinematics and the metallicity of the gas. Nevertheless, a fast, multi-phase, AGN-driven outflow with speeds up to 1000 km s\u22121is detected close to the nucleus at 1 kpc distance. A radio jet, in connection with the AGN radiation field, is likely responsible for driving the outflow as confirmed by the energetics and the spatial alignment of the jet and multi-phase outflow. Evidence for negative AGN feedback suppressing the star formation rate (SFR) is mild and restricted to the central kpc. But while any SFR suppression must have happened recently, the outflow has the potential to greatly impact the future evolution of the galaxy disc due to its geometrical orientation.Conclusions.. Our observations reveal that low-power radio jets can play a major role in driving fast, multi-phase, galaxy-scale outflows even in radio-quiet AGN. Since the outflow energetics for HE 1353\u22121917 are consistent with literature, scaling relation of AGN-driven outflows the contribution of radio jets as the driving mechanisms still needs to be systematically explored.",
"A significant fraction (30\u00a0per\u2009cent) of well-localized short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) lack a coincident host galaxy. This leads to two main scenarios: (i) that the progenitor system merged outside of the visible light of its host, or (ii) that the sGRB resided within a faint and distant galaxy that was not detected by follow-up observations. Discriminating between these scenarios has important implications for constraining the formation channels of neutron star mergers, the rate and environments of gravitational wave sources, and the production of heavy elements in the Universe. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign targeted at 31 sGRBs that lack a putative host galaxy. Our study effectively doubles the sample of well-studied sGRB host galaxies, now totaling 72 events of which $28{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ lack a coincident host to deep limits (r \u2273\u200926 or F110W\u2009\u2273\u200927 AB mag), and represents the largest homogeneously selected catalogue of sGRB offsets to date. We find that 70\u00a0per\u2009cent of sub-arcsecond localized sGRBs occur within 10\u00a0kpc of their host\u2019s nucleus, with a median projected physical offset of 5.6\u00a0kpc. Using this larger population, we discover an apparent redshift evolution in their locations: bursts at low-z occur at 2\u00a0\u00d7 larger offsets compared to those at z\u2009&gt;\u20090.5. This evolution could be due to a physical evolution of the host galaxies themselves or a bias against faint high-z galaxies. Furthermore, we discover a sample of hostless sGRBs at z\u2009\u2273\u20091 that are indicative of a larger high-z population, constraining the redshift distribution and disfavoring lognormal delay time models.",
"Context. OB star clusters originate from parsec-scale massive molecular clumps, while individual stars may form in \u22720.1 pc scale dense cores. The thermal properties of the clump gas are key factors governing the fragmentation process, and are closely affected by gas dynamics and feedback of forming stars.Aims. We aim to understand the evolution of temperature and density structures on the intermediate-scale (\u22720.1\u20131 pc) extended gas of massive clumps. This gas mass reservoir is critical for the formation of OB clusters, due to their extended inflow activities and intense thermal feedback during and after formation.Methods. We performed ~0.1 pc resolution observations of multiple molecular line tracers (e.g., CH3CCH, H2CS, CH3CN, CH3OH) that cover a wide range of excitation conditions, toward a sample of eight massive clumps. The sample covers different stages of evolution, and includes infrared-weak clumps and sources that are already hosting an HII region, spanning a wide luminosity-to-mass ratio (L\u2215M) range from ~1 to ~100 (L\u2299/M\u2299). Based on various radiative transfer models, we constrain the gas temperature and density structures and establish an evolutionary picture, aided by a spatially dependent virial analysis and abundance ratios of multiple species.Results. We determine temperature profiles varying in the range 30\u2013200 K over a continuous scale, from the center of the clumps out to 0.3\u20130.4 pc radii. The clumps\u2019 radial gas density profiles, described by radial power laws with slopes between \u22120.6 and ~\u22121.5, are steeper for more evolved sources, as suggested by results based on dust continuum, representing the bulk of the gas (~104 cm\u22123), and on CH3OH lines probing the dense gas (\u2273106\u2013108 cm\u22123) regime. The density contrast between the dense gas and the bulk gas increases with evolution, and may be indicative of spatially and temporally varying star formation efficiencies. The radial profiles of the virial parameter show a global variation toward a sub-virial state as the clump evolves. The linewidths probed by multiple tracers decline with increasing radius around the central core region and increase in the outer envelope, with a slope shallower than the case of the supersonic turbulence (\u03c3v \u221d r0.5) and the subsonic Kolmogorov scaling (\u03c3v \u221d r0.33). In the context of evolutionary indicators for massive clumps, we also find that the abundance ratios of [CCH]/[CH3OH] and [CH3CN]/[CH3OH] show correlations with clump L\u2215M.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The cosmic infrared background records much of the radiant energy released by processes of structure formation that have occurred since the decoupling of matter and radiation following the Big Bang. In the past few years, data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission provided the first measurements of this background, with additional constraints coming from studies of the attenuation of TeV \u03b3-rays. At the same time, there has been rapid progress in resolving a significant fraction of this background with the deep galaxy counts at infrared wavelengths from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) instruments and at submillimeter wavelengths from the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) instrument. This article reviews the measurements of the infrared background and sources contributing to it and discusses the implications for past and present cosmic processes.",
"Simulating and evolving magnetic fields within global galaxy simulations provides a large tangled web of numerical complexity due to the vast amount of physical processes involved. Understanding the numerical dependencies that act on the galactic dynamo is a crucial step in determining what resolution and conditions are required to properly capture the magnetic fields observed in galaxies. Here, we present an extensive study on the numerical dependencies of the galactic dynamo in isolated spiral galaxies using smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics. We performed 53 isolated spiral galaxy simulations with different initial setups, feedback, resolution, Jeans floor, and dissipation parameters. The results show a strong mean-field dynamo occurring in the spiral-arm region of the disk, likely produced by the classical alpha-omega dynamo or the recently described gravitational instability dynamo. The inclusion of feedback is seen to work in both a destructive and positive fashion for the amplification process. Destructive interference for the amplification occurs due to the breakdown of filament structure in the disk, the increase of turbulent diffusion, and the ejection of magnetic flux from the central plane to the circumgalactic medium. The positive effect of feedback is the increase in vertical motions and the turbulent fountain flows that develop, showing a high dependence on the small-scale vertical structure and the numerical dissipation within the galaxy. Galaxies with an effective dynamo saturate their magnetic energy density at levels between 10 and 30% of the thermal energy density. The density-averaged numerical Prandtl number is found to be below unity throughout the galaxy for all our simulations, with an increasing value with radius. Assuming a turbulent injection length of 1 kpc, the numerical magnetic Reynolds number is within the range of Remag\u2004=\u200410\u2005\u2212\u2005400, indicating that some regions are below the levels required for the small-scale dynamo (Remag,\u2006crit\u2004=\u200430\u2005\u2212\u20052700) to be active.",
"Context.We present SOFIA/FIFI-LS observations of three Class 0 and one Class I outflows (Cep E, HH 1, HH 212, and L1551 IRS5) in the far-infrared [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmand [O I]145\u2006\u03bcmtransitions. Spectroscopic [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmmaps enabled us to infer the spatial extent of warm (T\u2004\u223c\u2004500\u22121200\u2006K), low-excitation atomic gas within these protostellar outflows.Aims.Our main goal is to determine mass-loss rates from the obtained [OI]63\u2006\u03bcmmaps and compare these with accretion rates from other studies.Methods.The far-infrared [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmemission line is predicted to be the main coolant of dense, dissociative J-shocks caused by decelerated wind or jet shocks. If proper shock conditions prevail, the instantaneous mass-ejection rate is directly connected to the [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmluminosity. In order to unravel evolutionary trends, we analysed a set of 14 Class 0/I outflow sources that were spatially resolved in the [O I]63emission. We compared these data with a sample of 72 Class 0/I/II outflow sources that have been observed with Herschel (WISH, DIGIT, WILL, GASPS surveys) without spatially resolving the [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmline.Results.All our newly observed targets feature prominent [O I]63\u03bcmemission either close to the driving source (L1551 IRS5, HH 1, HH 212) or as extended jet-like or knotty emission region away from it (Cep E). The detected [O I]63\u2006\u03bcmemission can mostly be attributed to dissociative shocks and photodissociation regions (PDRs). Flux values at 63\u2006\u03bcm and 145\u2006\u03bcm of all four associated continuum sources are presented. We calculated mass-loss rates connected to the low-excitation, atomic outflow component in the range of (5\u221250)\u00d710\u22127\u2006M\u2299\u2006yr\u22121. Estimated ratios between the mass loss in the outflow and the mass accretion onto the source (jet efficiency ratios) are largely in the range of\u1e40out/\u1e40acc\u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.5 for the observed outflow sources, which are consistent with theoretical predictions and quoted Herschel data.Conclusions.Our new observations and a comparison with the 72 outflow sources observed with Herschel indicate that the bulk ejected material in outflows from Class 0 sources resides in the molecular component, that is mass-loss rates derived from the [O I]63emission line significantly underestimate the total mass-loss rate during this and possibly also later phases of the star formation process.",
"Motivated by recent progresses in the field of massive gravity, the paper at hand investigates the thermodynamical structure of black holes with three specific generalizations: i) Gauss\u2010Bonnet gravity which is motivated from string theory ii) PMI nonlinear electromagnetic field which is motivated from perspective of the QED correction iii) massive gravity which is motivated by obtaining the modification of standard general relativity. The exact solutions of this setup are extracted which are interpreted as black holes. In addition, thermodynamical quantities of the solutions are calculated and their critical behavior are studied. It will be shown that although massive and Gauss\u2010Bonnet gravities are both generalizations in gravitational sector, they show opposing effects regarding the critical behavior of the black holes. Furthermore, a periodic effect on number of the phase transition is reported for variation of the nonlinearity parameter and it will be shown that for super charged black holes, system is restricted in a manner that prevents it to reach the critical point and to acquire phase transition. In addition, the effects of geometrical structure on thermodynamical phase transition will be highlighted.",
" The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021 marks a new start for studies of galaxy formation at high redshift ( z \u2273 6) during the era of cosmic reionization. JWST can capture sensitive, high-resolution images and multiobject spectroscopy in the IR that will transform our view of galaxy formation during the first billion years of cosmic history. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of galaxies in reionizing intergalactic hydrogen ahead of JWST, achieved through observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based facilities including Keck, the Very Large Telescope, Subaru, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. We identify outstanding questions in the field that JWST can address during its mission lifetime, including with the planned JWST Cycle 1 programs. These findings include the following: \u25aa Surveys with JWST have sufficient sensitivity and area to complete the census of galaxy formation at the current redshift frontier ( z \u223c 8\u201310). \u25aa Rest-frame optical spectroscopy with JWST of galaxies will newly enable measures of star-formation rate, metallicity, and ionization at z \u223c 8\u20139, allowing for the astrophysics of early galaxies to be constrained. \u25aa The presence of evolved stellar populations at z \u223c 8\u201310 can be definitively tested by JWST, which would provide evidence of star formation out to z \u223c 15.

"Context. How the quiescent galaxies evolve with redshift and the factors that impact their evolution are still debated. It is still unclear what the dominant mechanisms of passive galaxy growth are and what role is played by the environment in shaping their evolutionary paths over cosmic time.Aims. The population of quiescent galaxies is altered over time by several processes that can affect their mean properties. Our aim is to study the mass\u2013size relation (MSR) of the quiescent population and to understand how the environment shapes the MSR at intermediate redshift.Methods. We used the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), a large spectroscopic survey of \u223c90 000 galaxies in the redshift range 0.5\u2004\u2264\u2004z\u2004\u2264\u20041.2. We selected a mass-complete sample of 4786 passive galaxies based on the NUVrK diagram and refined it using the Dn4000 spectral index to study the MSR of the passive population over 0.5\u2004\u2264\u2004z\u2004\u2264\u20040.9. The impact of the environment on the MSR and on the growth of the quiescent population is studied through the density contrast.Results. The slope and the intercept of the MSR, \u03b1\u2004=\u20040.62\u2005\u00b1\u20050.04 and log(A) = 0.52\u2005\u00b1\u20050.01, agree well with values from the literature at the same redshift. The intercept decreases with redshift, Re(z) = 8.20\u2005\u00d7\u2005(1\u2005+\u2005z)\u22121.70, while the slope remains roughly constant, and the same trend is observed in the low-density (LD) and high-density (HD) environments. Thanks to the largest spectroscopic sample at 0.5\u2004\u2264\u2004z\u2004\u2264\u20040.9, these results are not prone to redshift uncertainties from photometric measurements. We find that the average size of the quiescent population in the LD and HD environments are identical within 3\u03c3 and this result is robust against a change in the definition of the LD and HD environments or a change in the selection of quiescent galaxies. In the LD and HD environments, \u223c30 and \u223c40% of the population have experienced a minor merger process between 0.5\u2004\u2264\u2004z\u2004\u2264\u20040.9. However, minor mergers account only for 30\u201340% of the size evolution in this redshift range, the remaining evolution likely being due to the progenitor bias.",

" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Cosmic structure has formed as a result of gravitational amplification of primordial density fluctuations together with the action of other physical processes (adiabatic gas dynamics, radiative cooling, photoionization and recombination, radiative transfer). These complex nonlinear processes, acting over a wide range of length scales (from kiloparsecs to tens of megaparsecs), make this a difficult problem for computation. During the last two decades, significant progress has been made in developing numerical methods and statistical tools for analyzing simulations and data. Combined with observational advances, numerical simulations have led to the demise of several formerly popular models and to an improved understanding of galaxy clusters, quasistellar object (QSO) absorption line systems, and other phenomena. This review summarizes these advances. ",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 We discuss the present observational and theoretical understanding of the stellar populations of bulges and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution. The place of bulges as key to the Hubble Sequence remains secure, but some old paradigms are giving way to new ones as observations develop. Detailed studies of Local Group bulges and haloes provide a basis on which we consider higher redshift data. We present the evidence for and against the currently common preconceptions that bulges are old, above solar metallicity in the mean, and simply scaled-down versions of ellipticals. We conclude life is not so simple: Bulges are diverse and heterogeneous, and although their properties vary systematically, sometimes they are reminiscent of disks, sometimes of ellipticals. The extant observational data are, however, limited. New and future surveys will rectify this, and we discuss the questions those data will address.",
"Context.The study of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is fundamental to discern the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their connection with star formation and galaxy evolution. Due to the significant kinetic and radiative energy emitted by powerful AGNs, they are prime candidates to observe the interplay between SMBH and stellar growth in galaxies.Aims.We aim to develop a method to predict the AGN nature of a source, its radio detectability, and redshift purely based on photometry. The use of such a method will increase the number of radio AGNs, allowing us to improve our knowledge of accretion power into an SMBH, the origin and triggers of radio emission, and its impact on galaxy evolution.Methods.We developed and trained a pipeline of three machine learning (ML) models than can predict which sources are more likely to be an AGN and to be detected in specific radio surveys. Also, it can estimate redshift values for predicted radio-detectable AGNs. These models, which combine predictions from tree-based and gradient-boosting algorithms, have been trained with multi-wavelength data from near-infrared-selected sources in theHobby-EberlyTelescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring field. Training, testing, calibration, and validation were carried out in the HETDEX field. Further validation was performed on near-infrared-selected sources in the Stripe 82 field.Results.In the HETDEX validation subset, our pipeline recovers 96% of the initially labelled AGNs and, from AGNs candidates, we recover 50% of previously detected radio sources. For Stripe 82, these numbers are 94% and 55%. Compared to random selection, these rates are two and four times better for HETDEX, and 1.2 and 12 times better for Stripe 82. The pipeline can also recover the redshift distribution of these sources with\u03c3NMAD\u2004=\u20040.07 for HETDEX (\u03c3NMAD\u2004=\u20040.09 for Stripe 82) and an outlier fraction of 19% (25% for Stripe 82), compatible with previous results based on broad-band photometry. Feature importance analysis stresses the relevance of near- and mid-infrared colours to select AGNs and identify their radio and redshift nature.Conclusions.Combining different algorithms in ML models shows an improvement in the prediction power of our pipeline over a random selection of sources. Tree-based ML models (in contrast to deep learning techniques) facilitate the analysis of the impact that features have on the predictions. This prediction can give insight into the potential physical interplay between the properties of radio AGNs (e.g. mass of black hole and accretion rate).",
"We present the results of a set of high-resolution chemo-dynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies in a \u039bCDM cosmology. Out of an original (3.4 Mpc/h)3 cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are re-simulated from z = 70 to z = 0 using a zoom-in technique. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigated the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, stellar metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinematically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a \u039bCDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between 5 \u00d7 108 to a few 109 M\u2299, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding of the UV-background heating.",
"Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes\u2014including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking\u2014and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.",
"Context. In recent years, a number of Lyman continuum (LyC) leaker candidates have been found at intermediate redshifts, providing insight into how the Universe was reionised at early cosmic times. There are now around 100 known LyC leakers at all redshifts, which enables us to analyse their properties statistically.Aims. Here, we identify new LyC leaker candidates at z\u2004\u2248\u20043\u2005\u2212\u20054.5 and compare them to objects from the literature to get an overview of the different observed escape fractions and their relation to the properties of the Lyman \u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) emission line. The aim of this work is to test the indicators (or proxies) for LyC leakage suggested in the literature and to improve our understanding of the kinds of galaxies from which LyC radiation can escape.Methods. We used data from the Hubble Deep Ultraviolet (HDUV) legacy survey to search for LyC emission based on a sample of \u22482000 Ly\u03b1 emitters (LAEs) detected previously in two surveys with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), namely MUSE-Deep and MUSE-Wide. Based on the redshifts and positions of the LAEs, we look for potential LyC leakage in the WFC3/UVIS F336W band of the HDUV survey. The escape fractions are measured and compared in different ways, including spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting performed using the CIGALE software.Results. We add 12 objects to the sample of known LyC leaker candidates (5 highly likely leakers and 7 potential ones), 1 of which was previously known, and compare their Ly\u03b1 properties to their escape fractions. We find escape fractions of between \u223c20% and \u223c90%, assuming a high transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present a method whereby the number of LyC leaker candidates we find is used to infer the underlying average escape fraction of galaxies, which is \u224812%.Conclusion. Based on their Ly\u03b1 properties, we conclude that LyC leakers are not very different from other high-z LAEs and suggest that most LAEs could be leaking LyC even if this cannot always be detected because of the direction of emission and the transmission properties of the IGM.",
"Observations of circumstellar environments that look for the direct signal of exoplanets and the scattered light from disks have significant instrumental implications. In the past 15 years, major developments in adaptive optics, coronagraphy, optical manufacturing, wavefront sensing, and data processing, together with a consistent global system analysis have brought about a new generation of high-contrast imagers and spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes with much better performance. One of the most productive imagers is the Spectro-Polarimetic High contrast imager for Exoplanets REsearch (SPHERE), which was designed and built for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. SPHERE includes an extreme adaptive optics system, a highly stable common path interface, several types of coronagraphs, and three science instruments. Two of them, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and the Infra-Red Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), were designed to efficiently cover the near-infrared range in a single observation for an efficient search of young planets. The third instrument, ZIMPOL, was designed for visible polarimetric observation to look for the reflected light of exoplanets and the light scattered by debris disks. These three scientific instruments enable the study of circumstellar environments at unprecedented angular resolution, both in the visible and the near-infrared. In this work, we thoroughly present SPHERE and its on-sky performance after four years of operations at the VLT.",
"Aims. We perform a comprehensive determination of the systemic proper motions of 74 dwarf galaxies and dwarf galaxy candidates in the Local Group based on Gaia early data release 3. The outputs of the analysis for each galaxy, including probabilities of membership, will be made publicly available. The analysis is augmented by a determination of the orbital properties of galaxies within 500 kpc.Methods. We adopt a flexible Bayesian methodology presented in the literature, which takes into account the location of the stars on the sky, on the colour-magnitude diagram, and on the proper motion plane. We applied some modifications, in particular to the way the colour-magnitude diagram and spectroscopic information are factored in, for example, by including stars in several evolution phases. The bulk motions were integrated in three gravitational potentials: two where the Milky Way was treated in isolation and has a mass 0.9 & 1.6\u2005\u00d7\u20051012\u2006M\u2299, and a time-varying potential, which includes the infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).Results. We were able to determine bulk proper motions for 73 systems, and we consider 66 to be reliable measurements. For the first time, systemic motions are presented for galaxies out to a distance of 1.4 Mpc in the NGC 3109 association. The inclusion of the infall of a massive LMC significantly modifies the orbital trajectories of the objects, with respect to orbit integration in static Milky-Way-only potentials, and this leads to six galaxies likely being associated with the LMC, three possibly being associated with it, and one recently captured object. We discuss the results of the orbit integration in the context of the relation of the galaxies to the system of Milky Way satellites, implications for the too-big-to-fail problem, the impact on star formation histories, and tidal disruption.",
"Weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies provides a direct probe of the projected matter distribution in and around galaxy clusters. Here, we present a self-contained pedagogical review of cluster\u2013galaxy weak lensing, covering a range of topics relevant to its cosmological and astrophysical applications. We begin by reviewing the theoretical foundations of gravitational lensing from first principles, with a special attention to the basics and advanced techniques of weak gravitational lensing. We summarize and discuss key findings from recent cluster\u2013galaxy weak-lensing studies on both observational and theoretical grounds, with a focus on cluster mass profiles, the concentration\u2013mass relation, the splashback radius, and implications from extensive mass-calibration efforts for cluster cosmology.",
"The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a volume-complete sample of \u223c850 Galactic evolved stars within 3\u2009kpc at (sub-)mm wavelengths, observed in the CO J\u00a0= (2\u20131) and (3\u20132) rotational lines, and the sub-mm continuum, using the James Clark Maxwell Telescope and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. NESS consists of five tiers, based on distances and dust-production rate (DPR). We define a new metric for estimating the distances to evolved stars and compare its results to Gaia EDR3. Replicating other studies, the most-evolved, highly enshrouded objects in the Galactic Plane dominate the dust returned by our sources, and we initially estimate a total DPR of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 from our sample. Our sub-mm fluxes are systematically higher and spectral indices are typically shallower than dust models typically predict. The 450/850 $\\mu$m spectral indices are consistent with the blackbody Rayleigh\u2013Jeans regime, suggesting a large fraction of evolved stars have unexpectedly large envelopes of cold dust.",
"Ever since the discovery of the first active galactic nuclei (AGN), substantial observational and theoretical effort has been invested into understanding how massive black holes have evolved across cosmic time. Circum-nuclear obscuration is now established as a crucial component, with almost every AGN observed known to display signatures of some level of obscuration in their X-ray spectra. However, despite more than six decades of effort, substantial open questions remain: how does the accretion power impact the structure of the circum-nuclear obscurer? What are the dynamical properties of the obscurer? Can dense circum-nuclear obscuration exist around intrinsically weak AGN? How many intermediate mass black holes occupy the centers of dwarf galaxies? In this paper, we showcase a number of next-generation prospects attainable with the High-Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P1) to contribute toward solving these questions in the 2030s. The uniquely broad (0.2\u201380 keV) and strictly simultaneous X-ray passband of HEX-P makes it ideally suited for studying the temporal co-evolution between the central engine and circum-nuclear obscurer. Improved sensitivities and reduced background will enable the development of spectroscopic models complemented by current and future multi-wavelength observations. We show that the angular resolution of HEX-P both below and above 10 keV will enable the discovery and confirmation of accreting massive black holes at both low accretion power and low black hole masses even when concealed by thick obscuration. In combination with other next-generation observations of the dusty hearts of nearby galaxies, HEX-P will be pivotal in paving the way toward a complete picture of black hole growth and galaxy co-evolution.",
" Hot Jupiters were the first exoplanets to be discovered around main sequence stars and astonished us with their close-in orbits. They are a prime example of how exoplanets have challenged our textbook, solar-system inspired story of how planetary systems form and evolve. More than twenty years after the discovery of the first hot Jupiter, there is no consensus on their predominant origin channel. Three classes of hot Jupiter creation hypotheses have been proposed: in situ formation, disk migration, and high-eccentricity tidal migration. Although no origin channel alone satisfactorily explains all the evidence, two major origin channels together plausibly account for properties of hot Jupiters themselves and their connections to other exoplanet populations.

"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Abundance variations within globular clusters (GCs), and of GC stars with respect to field stars, are important diagnostics of a variety of physical phenomena, related to the evolution of individual stars, mass transfer in binary systems, and chemical evolution in high density environments. The broad astrophysical implications of GCs as building blocks of our knowledge of the Universe make a full understanding of their history and evolution basic in a variety of astrophysical fields. We review the current status of the research in this field, comparing the abundances in GCs with those obtained for field stars, discussing in depth the evidence for H-burning at high temperatures in GC stars, describing the process of self-enrichment in GCs with particular reference to the case of the most massive Galactic GC (\u03c9 Cen), and discussing various classes of cluster stars with abundance anomalies. Whereas the overall pattern might appear very complex at first sight, exciting new scenarios are opening where the interplay between GC dynamical and chemical properties are closely linked with each other.",
"Asteroseismology has opened a window on the internal physics of thousands of stars, by relating oscillation spectra properties to the internal physics of stars. Mode identification, namely the process of associating a measured oscillation frequency to the corresponding mode geometry and properties, is the cornerstone of this analysis of seismic spectra. In rapidly rotating stars this identification is a challenging task that remains incomplete, as modes assume complex geometries and regular patterns in frequencies get scrambled under the influence of the Coriolis force and centrifugal flattening. In this article, I will first discuss the various classes of mode geometries that emerge in rapidly rotating stars and the related frequency and period patterns, as predicted by ray dynamics, complete (non-)adiabatic calculations, or using the traditional approximation of rotation. These patterns scale with structural quantities and help us derive crucial constraints on the structure and evolution of these stars. I will summarize the amazing progress accomplished over the last few years for the deciphering of gravity-mode pulsator oscillation spectra, and recent developments based on machine-learning classification techniques to distinguish oscillation modes and pattern analysis strategies that let us access the underlying physics of pressure-mode pulsators. These approaches pave the way to ensemble asteroseismology of classical pulsators. Finally, I will highlight how these recent progress can be combined to improve forward seismic modelling. I will focus on the example of Rasalhague, a well-known rapid rotator, to illustrate the process and the needed advances to obtain \u00e0-la-carte modelling of such stars.",
"We describe the BEYONDPLANCKproject in terms of our motivation, methodology, and main products, and provide a guide to a set of companion papers that describe each result in more detail. Building directly on experience from ESA\u2019sPlanckmission, we implemented a complete end-to-end Bayesian analysis framework for thePlanckLow Frequency Instrument (LFI) observations. The primary product is a full joint posterior distributionP(\u03c9\u2005\u2223\u2005d), where\u03c9represents the set of all free instrumental (gain, correlated noise, bandpass, etc.), astrophysical (synchrotron, free-free, thermal dust emission, etc.), and cosmological (cosmic microwave background \u2013 CMB \u2013 map, power spectrum, etc.) parameters. Some notable advantages of this approach compared to a traditional pipeline procedure are seamless end-to-end propagation of uncertainties; accurate modeling of both astrophysical and instrumental effects in the most natural basis for each uncertain quantity; optimized computational costs with little or no need for intermediate human interaction between various analysis steps; and a complete overview of the entire analysis process within one single framework. As a practical demonstration of this framework, we focus in particular on low-\u2113CMB polarization reconstruction withPlanckLFI. In this process, we identify several important new effects that have not been accounted for in previous pipelines, including gain over-smoothing and time-variable and non-1/fcorrelated noise in the 30 and 44 GHz channels. Modeling and mitigating both previously known and newly discovered systematic effects, we find that all results are consistent with the \u039bCDM model, and we constrained the reionization optical depth to\u03c4\u2004=\u20040.066\u2005\u00b1\u20050.013, with a low-resolution CMB-based\u03c72probability to exceed of 32%. This uncertainty is about 30% larger than the official pipelines, arising from taking a more complete instrumental model into account. The marginal CMB solar dipole amplitude is 3362.7\u2005\u00b1\u20051.4\u2006\u03bcK, where the error bar was derived directly from the posterior distribution without the need of any ad hoc instrumental corrections. We are currently not aware of any significant unmodeled systematic effects remaining in thePlanckLFI data, and, for the first time, the 44 GHz channel is fully exploited in the current analysis. We argue that this framework can play a central role in the analysis of many current and future high-sensitivity CMB experiments, including LiteBIRD, and it will serve as the computational foundation of the emerging community-wide COSMOGLOBEeffort, which aims to combine state-of-the-art radio, microwave, and submillimeter data sets into one global astrophysical model.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 We review the state of observational and theoretical studies of the shaping of planetary nebulae (PNe) and protoplanetary nebulae (pPNe). In the past decade, high-resolution studies of PNe have revealed a bewildering array of morphologies with elaborate symmetries. Recent imaging studies of pPNe exhibit an even richer array of shapes. The variety of shapes, sometimes multiaxial symmetries, carefully arranged systems of low-ionization knots and jets, and the often Hubble-flow kinematics of PNe and pPNe indicate that there remains much to understand about the last stages of stellar evolution. In many cases, the basic symmetries and shapes of these objects develop on extremely short timescales, seemingly at the end of AGB evolution when the mode of mass loss abruptly and radically changes. No single explanation fits all of the observations. The shaping process may be related to external torques of a close or merging binary companion or the emergence of magnetic fields embedded in dense outflowing stellar winds. We suspect that a number of shaping processes may operate with different strengths and at different stages of the evolution of any individual object.",
"Context. OCS and SO2 are both major carriers of gaseous sulfur and are the only sulfurated molecules detected in interstellar ices to date. They are thus the ideal candidates for exploring the evolution of the volatile sulfur content throughout the different stages of star formation.Aims. We aim to investigate the chemical history of interstellar OCS and SO2 by deriving a statistically significant sample of gas-phase column densities toward massive protostars and comparing them to observations of gas and ices toward other sources, from dark clouds to comets.Methods. We analyzed a subset of 26 line-rich massive protostars observed by ALMA in Band 6 as part of the High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey. Column densities were derived for OCS and SO2 from their rare isotopologs O13CS and 34SO2 toward the compact gas around the hot cores. We compared the abundance ratios of gaseous OCS, SO2, and CH3OH with ice detections toward both high- and low-mass sources as well as dark clouds and comets.Results. We find that gas-phase column density ratios of OCS and SO2 with respect to methanol remain fairly constant as a function of luminosity between low- and high-mass sources, despite their very different physical conditions. In our dataset, OCS and SO2 are weakly correlated. The derived gaseous OCS and SO2 abundances relative to CH3OH are overall similar to protostellar ice values, with a significantly larger scatter for SO2 than for OCS. Cometary and dark-cloud ice values agree well with protostellar gas-phase ratios for OCS, whereas higher abundances of SO2 are generally seen in comets compared to the other sources. Gaseous SO2/OCS ratios are consistent with ices toward dark clouds, protostars, and comets, albeit with some scatter.Conclusions. The constant gas-phase column density ratios throughout low- and high-mass sources indicate an early-stage formation before intense environmental differentiation begins. Icy protostellar values are similar to the gas-phase medians and are compatible with an icy origin for these species followed by thermal sublimation. The larger spread in SO2 compared to OCS ratios with respect to CH3OH is likely due to a more water-rich chemical environment associated with the former, as opposed to a CO-rich origin for the latter. Post-sublimation gas-phase processing of SO2 can also contribute to the large spread. Comparisons to ices in dark clouds and comets point to a significant inheritance of OCS from earlier to later evolutionary stages.",
"We report the discovery of five transiting companions near the hydrogen-burning mass limit in close orbits around main sequence stars originally identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as TESS objects of interest (TOIs): TOI-148, TOI-587, TOI-681, TOI-746, and TOI-1213. Using TESS and ground-based photometry as well as radial velocities from the CORALIE, CHIRON, TRES, and FEROS spectrographs, we found the companions have orbital periods between 4.8 and 27.2 days, masses between 77 and 98 MJup\u00a0, and radii between 0.81 and 1.66 RJup\u00a0. These targets have masses near the uncertain lower limit of hydrogen core fusion (~73-96 MJup\u00a0), which separates brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We constrained young ages for TOI-587 (0.2 \u00b1 0.1 Gyr) and TOI-681 (0.17 \u00b1 0.03 Gyr) and found them to have relatively larger radii compared to other transiting companions of a similar mass. Conversely we estimated older ages for TOI-148 and TOI-746 and found them to have relatively smaller companion radii. With an effective temperature of 9800 \u00b1 200 K, TOI-587 is the hottest known main-sequence star to host a transiting brown dwarf or very low-mass star. We found evidence of spin-orbit synchronization for TOI-148 and TOI-746 as well as tidal circularization for TOI-148. These companions add to the population of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars with well measured parameters ideal to test formation models of these rare objects, the origin of the brown dwarf desert, and the distinction between brown dwarfs and hydrogen-burning main sequence stars.",
"This work aims to present our current best physical understanding of common-envelope evolution (CEE). We highlight areas of consensus and disagreement, and stress ideas which should point the way forward for progress in this important but long-standing and largely unconquered problem. Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.",
"High-resolution optical spectra of 30 metal-poor stars selected from the Pristine survey are presented, based on observations taken with the Gemini Observatory GRACES spectrograph. Stellar parameters Teff and log\u2009g are determined using a Gaia DR2 colour\u2013temperature calibration and surface gravity from the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann equation. GRACES spectra are used to determine chemical abundances (or upper limits) for 20 elements (Li, O, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Ti, Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). These stars are confirmed to be metal-poor ([Fe/H]\u2009&lt;\u2009\u22122.5), with higher precision than from earlier medium-resolution analyses. The chemistry for most targets is similar to other extremely metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Three stars near [Fe/H]\u00a0= \u22123.0 have unusually low Ca and high Mg, suggestive of contributions from few SN\u00a0II where alpha-element formation through hydrostatic nucleosynthesis was more efficient. Three new carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are also identified (two CEMP-s and one potential CEMP-no star) when our chemical abundances are combined with carbon from previous medium-resolution analyses. The GRACES spectra also provide precision radial velocities (\u03c3RV\u00a0\u2264 0.2\u2009km\u2009s\u22121) for dynamical orbit calculations with the Gaia DR2 proper motions. Most of our targets are dynamically associated with the Galactic halo; however, five stars with [Fe/H]\u2009&lt;\u2009\u22123 have planar-like orbits, including one retrograde star. Another five stars are dynamically consistent with the Gaia-Sequoia accretion event; three have typical halo [\u03b1/Fe] ratios for their metallicities, whereas two are [Mg/Fe]-deficient, and one is a new CEMP-s candidate. These results are discussed in terms of the formation and early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.",
"Context.The search of close (a\u2272 5 au) giant planet (GP) companions with radial velocity (RV) around young stars and the estimate of their occurrence rates is important to constrain the migration timescales. Furthermore, this search will allow the giant planet occurrence rates to be computed at all separations via the combination with direct imaging techniques. The RV search around young stars is a challenge as they are generally faster rotators than older stars of similar spectral types and they exhibit signatures of magnetic activity (spots) or pulsation in their RV time series. Specific analyses are necessary to characterize, and possibly correct for, this activity.Aims.Our aim is to search for planets around young nearby stars and to estimate the GP occurrence rates for periods up to 1000 days.Methods.We used the SOPHIEspectrograph on the 1.93 m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory to observe 63\u00a0A\u2212Myoung (<400 Myr) stars. We used our Spectroscopic data via Analysis of the Fourier Interspectrum Radial velocities software to compute the RVs and other spectroscopic observables. We then combined this survey with the HARPSYNS survey to compute the companion occurrence rates on a total of 120 youngA\u2212Mstars.Results.We report one new trend compatible with a planetary companion on HD 109647. We also report HD 105693 and HD 112097 as binaries, and we confirm the binarity of HD 2454, HD 13531, HD 17250 A, HD 28945, HD 39587, HD 131156, HD 142229, HD 186704 A, and HD 195943. We constrained for the first time the orbital parameters of HD 195943 B. We refute the HD 13507 single brown dwarf (BD) companion solution and propose a double BD companion solution. Two GPs were previously reported from this survey in the HD 113337 system. Based on our sample of 120 young stars, we obtain a GP occurrence rate of 1\u22120.3+2.2% for periods lower than 1000 days, and we obtain an upper limit on BD occurrence rate of 0.9\u22120.9+2% in the same period range. We report a possible lack of close (P\u2208 [1;1000]\u00a0days) GPs around young FK stars compared to their older counterparts, with a confidence level of 90%.",
"It is now well established that galaxies have different morphologies, gas contents, and star formation rates (SFR) in dense environments like galaxy clusters. The impact of environmental density extends to several virial radii, and galaxies appear to be pre-processed in filaments and groups before falling into the cluster. Our goal is to quantify this pre-processing in terms of gas content and SFR, as a function of density in cosmic filaments. We have observed the two first CO transitions in 163 galaxies with the IRAM-30 m telescope, and added 82 more measurements from the literature, thus forming a sample of 245 galaxies in the filaments around the Virgo cluster. We gathered HI-21cm measurements from the literature and observed 69 galaxies with the Nan\u00e7ay telescope to complete our sample. We compare our filament galaxies with comparable samples from the Virgo cluster and with the isolated galaxies of the AMIGA sample. We find a clear progression from field galaxies to filament and cluster galaxies for decreasing SFR, increasing fraction of galaxies in the quenching phase, an increasing proportion of early-type galaxies, and decreasing gas content. Galaxies in the quenching phase, defined as having a SFR below one-third of that of the main sequence (MS), are only between 0% and 20% in the isolated sample, according to local galaxy density, while they are 20%\u201360% in the filaments and 30%\u201380% in the Virgo cluster. Processes that lead to star formation quenching are already at play in filaments; they depend mostly on the local galaxy density, while the distance to the filament spine is a secondary parameter. While the HI-to-stellar-mass ratio decreases with local density by an order of magnitude in the filaments, and two orders of magnitude in the Virgo cluster with respect to the field, the decrease is much less for the H2-to-stellar-mass ratio. As the environmental density increases, the gas depletion time decreases, because the gas content decreases faster than the SFR. This suggests that gas depletion precedes star formation quenching.",
"Context.TheSpitzerSurvey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) is a detailed study of over 2300 nearby galaxies in the near-infrared (NIR), which has been critical to our understanding of the detailed structures of nearby galaxies. Because the sample galaxies were selected only using radio-derived velocities, however, the survey favored late-type disk galaxies over lenticulars and ellipticals.Aims.A follow-upSpitzersurvey was conducted to rectify this bias, adding 465 early-type galaxies (ETGs) to the original sample, to be analyzed in a manner consistent with the initial survey. We present the data release of this ETG extension, up to the third data processing pipeline (P3): surface photometry.Methods.We produce curves of growth and radial surface brightness profiles (with and without inclination corrections) using reduced and maskedSpitzerIRAC 3.6 \u03bcm and 4.5 \u03bcm images produced through Pipelines 1 and 2, respectively. From these profiles, we derive the following integrated quantities: total magnitudes, stellar masses, concentration parameters, and galaxy size metrics. We showcase NIR scaling relations for ETGs among these quantities.Results.We examine general trends across the whole S4G and ETG extension among our derived parameters, highlighting differences between ETGs and late-type galaxies (LTGs). The latter are, on average, more massive and more concentrated than LTGs, and subtle distinctions are seen among ETG morphological subtypes. We also derive the following scaling relations and compare them with previous results in visible light: mass-size (both half-light and isophotal), mass-concentration, mass-surface brightness (central, effective, and within 1 kpc), and mass-color.Conclusions.We find good agreement with previous works, though some relations (e.g., mass-central surface brightness) will require more careful multicomponent decompositions to be fully understood. The relations between mass and isophotal radius and between mass and surface brightness within 1 kpc, in particular, show notably small scatter. The former provides important constraints on the limits of size growth in galaxies, possibly related to star formation thresholds, while the latter\u2013particularly when paired with the similarly tight relation for LTGs\u2013showcases the striking self-similarity of galaxy cores, suggesting they evolve little over cosmic time. All of the profiles and parameters described in this paper will be provided to the community via the NASA/IPAC database on a dedicated website.",
"We present the results of the most comprehensive survey of the Galactic plane in very high-energy (VHE)\u03b3-rays, including a public release of Galactic sky maps, a catalog of VHE sources, and the discovery of 16 new sources of VHE\u03b3-rays. The High Energy Spectroscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic plane survey (HGPS) was a decade-long observation program carried out by the H.E.S.S. I array of Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia from 2004 to 2013. The observations amount to nearly 2700 h of quality-selected data, covering the Galactic plane at longitudes from\u2113= 250\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 and latitudes |b|\u2264 3\u00b0. In addition to the unprecedented spatial coverage, the HGPS also features a relatively high angular resolution (0.08\u00b0 \u2248 5 arcmin mean point spread function 68% containment radius), sensitivity (\u22721.5% Crab flux for point-like sources), and energy range (0.2\u2013100 TeV). We constructed a catalog of VHE\u03b3-ray sources from the HGPS data set with a systematic procedure for both source detection and characterization of morphology and spectrum. We present this likelihood-based method in detail, including the introduction of a model component to account for unresolved, large-scale emission along the Galactic plane. In total, the resulting HGPS catalog contains 78 VHE sources, of which 14 are not reanalyzed here, for example, due to their complex morphology, namely shell-like sources and the Galactic center region. Where possible, we provide a firm identification of the VHE source or plausible associations with sources in other astronomical catalogs. We also studied the characteristics of the VHE sources with source parameter distributions. 16 new sources were previously unknown or unpublished, and we individually discuss their identifications or possible associations. We firmly identified 31 sources as pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), supernova remnants (SNRs), composite SNRs, or gamma-ray binaries. Among the 47 sources not yet identified, most of them (36) have possible associations with cataloged objects, notably PWNe and energetic pulsars that could power VHE PWNe.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Radio emission from solar flares offers a number of unique diagnostic tools to address long-standing questions about energy release, plasma heating, particle acceleration, and particle transport in magnetized plasmas. At millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission from electrons with energies of tens of kilo electron volts to several mega electron volts plays a dominant role. These electrons carry a significant fraction of the energy released during the impulsive phase of flares. At decimeter and meter wavelengths, coherent plasma radiation can play a dominant role. Particularly important are type III and type III\u2013like radio bursts, which are due to upward- and downward-directed beams of nonthermal electrons, presumed to originate in the energy release site. With the launch of Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, the relationship between radio emission and energetic photon emissions has been clarified. In this review, recent progress on our Dunderstanding of radio emission from impulsive flares and its relation to X-ray emission is discussed, as well as energy release in flare-like phenomena (microflares, nanoflares) and their bearing on coronal heating.",
"Context. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the location where the interplay between large-scale outflows and accretion onto galaxies occurs. Metals in different ionization states flowing between the circumgalactic and intergalactic mediums are affected by large galactic outflows and low-ionization state inflowing gas. Observational studies on their spatial distribution and their relation with galaxy properties may provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.Aims. The main goal of this paper is to provide new insights into the spatial distribution of the circumgalactic of star-forming galaxies at 1.5\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20044.5 (\u27e8z\u27e9\u223c2.6) in the peak epoch of cosmic star formation activity in the Universe. We also look for possible correlations between the strength of the low- and high-ionization absorption features (LIS and HIS) and stellar mass, star formation rate, effective radius, and azimuthal angle \u03d5 that defines the location of the absorbing gas relative to the galaxy disc plane.Methods. The CGM has been primarily detected via the absorption features that it produces on the continuum spectrum of bright background sources. We selected a sample of 238 close pairs from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey to examine the spatial distribution of the gas located around star-forming galaxies and generate composite spectra by co-adding spectra of background galaxies that provide different sight-lines across the CGM of star-forming galaxies.Results. We detect LIS (C\u202fII and Si\u202fII) and HIS (Si\u202fIV, C\u202fIV) up to separations \u27e8b\u27e9 = 172 kpc and 146 kpc. Beyond this separation, we do not detect any significant signal of CGM absorption in the background composite spectra. Our Ly\u03b1, LIS, and HIS rest-frame equivalent width (W0) radial profiles are at the upper envelope of the W0 measurements at lower redshifts, suggesting a potential redshift evolution for the CGM gas content producing these absorptions. We find a correlation between C\u202fII and C\u202fIV with star formation rate and stellar mass, as well as trends with galaxy size estimated by the effective radius and azimuthal angle. Galaxies with high star formation rate (log[SFR/(M\u2299 yr\u22121)]\u2004>\u20041.5) and stellar mass (log[M\u22c6/M\u2299] > 10.2) show stronger C\u202fIV absorptions compared with those low SFR (log[SFR/(M\u2299 yr\u22121)]\u2004<\u20040.9) and low stellar mass (log[M\u22c6/M\u2299] < 9.26). The latter population instead shows stronger C\u202fII absorption than their more massive or more star-forming counterparts. We compute the C\u202fII/C\u202fIVW0 line ratio that confirms the C\u202fII and C\u202fIV correlations with impact parameter, stellar mass, and star formation rate. We do not find any correlation with \u03d5 in agreement with other high-redshift studies and in contradiction to what is observed at low redshift where large-scale outflows along the minor axis forming bipolar outflows are detected.Conclusions. We find that the stronger C\u202fIV line absorptions in the outer regions of these star-forming galaxies could be explained by stronger outflows in galaxies with higher star formation rates and stellar masses that are capable of projecting the ionized gas up to large distances and/or by stronger UV ionizing radiation in these galaxies that is able to ionize the gas even at large distances. On the other hand, low-mass galaxies show stronger C\u202fII absorptions, suggesting larger reservoirs of cold gas that could be explained by a softer radiation field unable to ionize high-ionization state lines or by the galactic fountain scenario where metal-rich gas ejected from previous star formation episodes falls back to the galaxy. These large reservoirs of cold neutral gas around low-mass galaxies could be funnelled into the galaxies and eventually provide the necessary fuel to sustain star formation activity.",
"The cosmological principle is fundamental to the standard cosmological model. It assumes that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on very large scales. As the basic assumption, it must stand the test of various observations. In this work, we investigated the properties of the Pantheon+ sample, including redshift distribution and position distribution, and we give its constraint on the flat \u039bCDM model: \u03a9m = 0.36 \u00b1 0.02 and H0 = 72.83 \u00b1 0.23 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. Then, using the region fitting (RF) method, we mapped the all-sky distribution of cosmological parameters (\u03a9m and H0) and find that the distribution significantly deviates from isotropy. A local matter underdensity region exists toward (308.4\u00b0\u221248.7+47.6, \u221218.2\u00b0\u221228.8+21.1) as well as a preferred direction of the cosmic anisotropy (313.4\u00b0\u221218.2+19.6, \u221216.8\u00b0\u221210.7+11.1) in galactic coordinates. Similar directions may imply that local matter density might be responsible for the anisotropy of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real-data positions (RP) show high confidence levels. For the local matter underdensity, the statistical significances are 2.78\u03c3 (isotropy) and 2.34\u03c3 (isotropy RP). For the cosmic anisotropy, the statistical significances are 3.96\u03c3 (isotropy) and 3.15\u03c3 (isotropy RP). The comparison of these two kinds of statistical isotropy analyses suggests that inhomogeneous spatial distribution of real sample can increase the deviation from isotropy. The similar results and findings are also found from reanalyses of the low-redshift sample (lp+) and the lower screening angle (\u03b8max = 60\u00b0), but with a slight decrease in statistical significance. Overall, our results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy. This possibility must be taken seriously. Further testing is needed to better understand this signal.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Gravitational lenses can provide crucial information on the geometry of the Universe, on the cosmological scenario of formation of its structures as well as on the history of its components with look-back time. In this review, I focus on the most recent results obtained during the last five years from the analysis of the weak lensing regime. The potential of weak lensing as a probe of dark matter and the study of the coupling between light and mass on scales of clusters of galaxies, large-scale structures and galaxies is discussed first. Then I present the impact of weak lensing for the study of distant galaxies and of the population of lensed sources as a function of redshift. Finally, I discuss the potential of weak lensing to constrain the cosmological parameters, either from pure geometrical effects observed in peculiar lenses, or from the coupling of weak lensing with the CMB.",
"Aims. With the latest Gaia DR3 data, we analyse the widest pairs in the Washington Double Star (WDS) catalogue with angular separations, \u03c1, greater than 1000 arcsec.Methods. We confirmed the pairs\u2019 membership to stellar systems based on common proper motions, parallaxes, and (when available) radial velocities, together with the locii of the individual components in colour-magnitude diagrams. We also looked for additional closer companions to the ultrawide pairs, either reported by WDS or found by us with a new Gaia astrometric search. In addition, we determined masses for each star (and white dwarf) and, with the projected physical separation, computed the gravitational potential energy, |Ug*|, of the systems.Results. Of the 155 159 pairs currently catalogued by WDS, there are 504 with \u03c1 > 1000 arcsec. Of these, only 2 ultrawide pairs have not been identified, 10 do not have any available astrometry, 339 have not passed a conservative filtering in proper motion or parallax, 59 are members of young stellar kinematic groups, associations or open clusters, and only 94 remain as bona fide ultrawide pairs in the galactic field. Accounting for the additional members at shorter separations identified in a complementary astrometric and bibliographic search, we found 79 new stars (39 reported, plus 40 not reported by WDS) in 94 ultrawide stellar systems. This sample is expanded when including new close binary candidates with large Gaia DR3 RUWE, \u03c3Vr, or a proper motion anomaly. Furthermore, the large fraction of subsystems and the non-hierarchical configurations of many wide systems with three or more stars is remarkable. In particular, we found 14 quadruple, 2 quintuple, 3 sextuple, and 2 septuple systems. The minimum computed binding energies, |Ug*| ~ 1033 J, are in line with theoretical predictions of tidal destruction by the Galactic gravitational potential. The most fragile and massive systems have huge projected physical separations of well over 1 pc. Therefore, they are either in the process of disruption or they are part of unidentified juvenile stellar kinematic groups.",
"Submillimeter surveys toward overdense regions in the early Universe are essential for uncovering the obscured star formation and the cold gas content of assembling galaxies within massive dark matter halos. In this work, we present deep ALMA mosaic observations covering an area of \u223c2\u2032\u00d72\u2032 around MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01), one of the largest and brightest Ly-\u03b1 emitting nebulae discovered thus far; it surrounds a radio-quiet quasar at z\u2004\u2243\u20043.25. Our observations target the 1.2 and the 3 mm dust continuum as well as the carbon monoxide CO(4\u20133) transition in galaxies in the vicinity of the quasar. We identify a robust sample of 11 CO-line-emitting galaxies (including a closely separated quasar companion) that lie within \u00b14000\u2006km\u2006s\u22121 of the quasar systemic redshift. A fraction of these objects were missed in previous deep rest-frame optical/UV surveys, which highlights the critical role of (sub)millimeter imaging. We also detect a total of 11 sources revealed in the dust continuum at 1.2 mm; six of them have either high-fidelity spectroscopic redshift information from rest-frame UV metal absorptions or the CO(4\u20133) line that places them in the same narrow redshift range. A comparison of the CO luminosity function and 1.2 mm number count density with those of the general fields points to a galaxy overdensity of \u03b4\u2004>\u200410. We find evidence of a systematic flattening at the bright end of the CO luminosity function with respect to the trend measured in blank fields. Our findings reveal that galaxies in dense regions at z\u2004\u223c\u20043 are more massive and significantly richer in molecular gas than galaxies in fields, which enables a faster and accelerated assembly. This is the first in a series of studies aimed at characterizing one of the densest regions of the Universe found so far at z\u2004>\u20043.",
"Context. Sources at the brightest end of the quasi-stellar object (QSO) luminosity function, during the peak epoch in the history of star formation and black hole accretion (z\u2004\u223c\u20042\u22124, often referred to as \u201cCosmic noon\u201d) are privileged sites to study the cycle of feeding & feedback processes in massive galaxies.Aims. We aim to perform the first systematic study of cold gas properties in the most luminous QSOs, by characterising their host-galaxies and environment. These targets exhibit indeed widespread evidence of outflows at nuclear and galactic scales.Methods. We analyse ALMA, NOEMA and JVLA observations of the far-infrared continuum, CO and [CII] emission lines in eight QSOs (bolometric luminosity LBol\u2004\u2273\u20043\u2005\u00d7\u20051047 erg s\u22121) from the WISE-SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSOs sample at z\u2004\u223c\u20042.4\u22124.7.Results. We report a 100% emission line detection rate and a 80% detection rate in continuum emission, and we find CO emission to be consistent with the steepest CO ladders observed so far. Sub-millimetre data reveal presence of (one or more) bright companion galaxies around \u223c80% of WISSH QSOs, at projected distances of \u223c6\u2212130 kpc. We observe a variety of sizes for the molecular gas reservoirs (\u223c1.7\u221210 kpc), mostly associated with rotating disks with disturbed kinematics. WISSH QSOs typically show lower CO luminosity and higher star formation efficiency than infrared matched, z\u2004\u223c\u20040\u22123 main-sequence galaxies, implying that, given the observed SFR \u223c170\u22121100 M\u2299 yr\u22121, molecular gas is converted into stars in \u227250 Myr. Most targets show extreme dynamical to black-hole mass ratios Mdyn/MBH\u2004\u223c\u20043\u221210, two orders of magnitude smaller than local relations. The molecular gas fraction in the host-galaxies of WISSH is lower by a factor of \u223c10\u2212100 than in star forming galaxies with similar M*.Conclusions. Our analysis reveals that hyper-luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon undergo an intense growth phase of both the central super-massive black hole and of the host-galaxy. These systems pinpoint the high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble, where we show that mergers play a major role in the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass. We suggest that the observed low molecular gas fraction and short depletion timescale are due to AGN feedback, whose presence is indicated by fast AGN-driven ionised outflows in all our targets.",
"Massive stars play a major role in the evolution of their host galaxies and serve as important probes of the distant Universe. It has been established that the majority of massive stars reside in close binaries and interact with their companion stars during their lifetimes. Such interactions drastically alter their life cycles and complicate our understanding of their evolution, but are also responsible for the production of interesting and exotic interaction products.\n\u25aaExtensive observation campaigns with well-understood detection sensitivities have enabled the conversion of observed properties into intrinsic characteristics, facilitating a direct comparison to theory.\u25aaStudies of large samples of massive stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds have unveiled new types of interaction products, providing critical constraints on the mass transfer phase and the formation of compact objects.\u25aaThe direct detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized the study of stellar mass compact objects, providing a new window to study massive star evolution. Their formation processes are, however, still unclear. The known sample of compact object mergers will increase by orders of magnitude in the coming decade, which is vastly outgrowing the number of stellar-mass compact objects detected through electromagnetic radiation.\n            ",
"The Lunar Orbital Platform - Gateway (LOP - Gateway, or simply Gateway) is a crewed platform that will be assembled and operated in the vicinity of the Moon by NASA and international partner organizations, including ESA, starting from the mid-2020s. It will offer new opportunities for fundamental and applied scientific research. The Moon is a unique location to study the deep space plasma environment. Moreover, the lunar surface and the surface-bounded exosphere are interacting with this environment, constituting a complex multi-scale interacting system. This paper examines the opportunities provided by externally mounted payloads on the Gateway in the field of space plasma physics, heliophysics and space weather, and also examines the impact of the space environment on an inhabited platform in the vicinity of the Moon. It then presents the conceptual design of a model payload, required to perform these space plasma measurements and observations. It results that the Gateway is very well-suited for space plasma physics research. It allows a series of scientific objectives with a multi-disciplinary dimension to be addressed.",
" The New Horizons (NH) flyby of the Pluto\u2013Charon binary planet and its system of four small surrounding satellites in mid-2015 revolutionized our knowledge of this distant planet and its moons. Beyond providing rich geo-logical, compositional, and atmospheric data sets, NH demonstrated that Pluto has been surprisingly geologically and climatologically active throughout the past 4+ Gyr and that the planet exhibits a remarkably complex range of atmospheric phenomenology and geological expressions that rival Mars in their richness. In contrast, Pluto's large, planet-sized satellite Charon, though also geologically complex, has no detected active surface volatiles, has no detectable atmosphere, has much more muted colors, has lower albedo, and exhibits only ancient terrains. Pluto's system of four small satellites orbiting outside of Charon is itself dynamically complex and geologically interesting. Here, we review both what was known about the Pluto system before NH and what it has taught us about the Pluto system specifically and, by inference, other small planets in the Kuiper Belt. We go on to examine the natural next steps in Kuiper Belt exploration. ",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Blueshifted absorption lines in the UV and X-ray spectra of active galaxies reveal the presence of massive outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei. The \u201cintrinsic\u201d UV and X-ray absorbers show large global covering factors of the central continuum source, and the inferred mass loss rates are comparable to the mass accretion rates. Many absorbers show variable ionic column densities, which are attributed to a combination of variable ionizing flux and motion of gas into and out of the line of sight. Detailed studies of the intrinsic absorbers, with the assistance of monitoring observations and photoionization models, provide constraints on their kinematics, physical conditions, and locations relative to the central continuum source, which range from the inner nucleus (\u223c0.01 pc) to the galactic disk or halo (\u223c10 kpc). Dynamical models that make use of thermal winds, radiation pressure, and/or hydromagnetic flows have reached a level of sophistication that permits comparisons with the observational constraints.",
"The evolution of young stars and disks is driven by the interplay of several processes, notably the accretion and ejection of material. These processes, critical to correctly describe the conditions of planet formation, are best probed spectroscopically. Between 2020 and 2022, about 500orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are being devoted in to the ULLYSES public survey of about 70 low-mass (M\u22c6\u2004\u2264\u20042\u2006M\u2299) young (age < 10 Myr) stars at UV wavelengths. Here, we present the PENELLOPE Large Program carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) with the aim of acquiring, contemporaneously to the HST, optical ESPRESSO/UVES high-resolution spectra for the purpose of investigating the kinematics of the emitting gas, along with UV-to-NIR X-shooter medium-resolution flux-calibrated spectra to provide the fundamental parameters that HST data alone cannot provide, such as extinction and stellar properties. The data obtained by PENELLOPE have no proprietary time and the fully reduced spectra are being made available to the whole community. Here, we describe the data and the first scientific analysis of the accretion properties for the sample of 13 targets located in the Orion OB1 association and in the \u03c3-Orionis cluster, observed in November\u2013December 2020. We find that the accretion rates are in line with those observed previously in similarly young star-forming regions, with a variability on a timescale of days (\u22723). The comparison of the fits to the continuum excess emission obtained with a slab model on the X-shooter spectra and the HST/STIS spectra shows a shortcoming in the X-shooter estimates of \u227210%, which is well within the assumed uncertainty. Its origin can be either due to an erroneous UV extinction curve or to the simplicity of the modeling and, thus, this question will form the basis of the investigation undertaken over the course of the PENELLOPE program. The combined ULLYSES and PENELLOPE data will be key in attaining a better understanding of the accretion and ejection mechanisms in young stars.",
"Context. We describe the atomic and molecular data that were used for the abundance analyses of FGK-type stars carried out within the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey in the years 2012 to 2019. The Gaia-ESO Survey is one among several current and future stellar spectroscopic surveys producing abundances for Milky-Way stars on an industrial scale.Aims. We present an unprecedented effort to create a homogeneous common line list, which was used by several abundance analysis groups using different radiative transfer codes to calculate synthetic spectra and equivalent widths. The atomic data are accompanied by quality indicators and detailed references to the sources. The atomic and molecular data are made publicly available at the CDS.Methods. In general, experimental transition probabilities were preferred but theoretical values were also used. Astrophysical gf-values were avoided due to the model-dependence of such a procedure. For elements whose lines are significantly affected by a hyperfine structure or isotopic splitting, a concerted effort has been made to collate the necessary data for the individual line components. Synthetic stellar spectra calculated for the Sun and Arcturus were used to assess the blending properties of the lines. We also performed adetailed investigation of available data for line broadening due to collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms.Results. Among a subset of over 1300 lines of 35 elements in the wavelength ranges from 475 to 685 nm and from 850 to 895 nm, we identified about 200 lines of 24 species which have accurate gf-values and are free of blends in the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus. For the broadening due to collisions with neutral hydrogen, we recommend data based on Anstee-Barklem-O\u2019Mara theory, where possible. We recommend avoiding lines of neutral species for which these are not available. Theoretical broadening data by R.L. Kurucz should be used for Sc\u202fII, Ti\u202fII, and Y\u202fII lines; additionally, for ionised rare-earth species, the Uns\u00f6ld approximation with an enhancement factor of 1.5 for the line width can be used.Conclusions. The line list has proven to be a useful tool for abundance determinations based on the spectra obtained within the Gaia-ESO Survey, as well as other spectroscopic projects. Accuracies below 0.2 dex are regularly achieved, where part of the uncertainties are due to differences in the employed analysis methods. Desirable improvements in atomic data were identified for a number of species, most importantly Al\u202fI, S\u202fI, and Cr\u202fII, but also Na\u202fI, Si\u202fI, Ca\u202fII, and Ni\u202fI.",
" Adaptive optics is a prime example of how progress in observational astronomy can be driven by technological developments. At many observatories it is now considered to be part of a standard instrumentation suite, enabling ground-based telescopes to reach the diffraction limit and, thus, providing spatial resolution superior to that achievable from space with current or planned satellites. In this review, we consider adaptive optics from the astrophysical perspective. We show that adaptive optics has led to important advances in our understanding of a multitude of astrophysical processes and describe how the requirements from science applications are now driving the development of the next generation of novel adaptive optics techniques.

"We present spectroscopic observations of 466 galaxies in and around a superstructure at z\u2004\u223c\u20040.84 targeted by the VIMOS Spectroscopic Survey of a Supercluster in the COSMOS field (VIS3COS). We use [OII]\u03bb3727, H\u03b4, and Dn4000 to trace recent, medium-, and long-term star formation histories and investigate the effect of stellar mass and local environment on them. By studying trends in individual and composite galaxy spectra, we find that stellar mass and environment play a role in the observed galactic properties. Galaxies with low stellar mass (10\u2004< \u2004log10(M\u22c6/M\u2299) < 10.5) in the field show the strongest H\u03b4 absorption. Similarly, the massive population (log10(M\u22c6/M\u2299) > 11) shows an increase in H\u03b4 absorption strengths in intermediate-density environments (e.g. filaments). Galaxies with intermediate stellar mass (10.5\u2004< \u2004log10(M\u22c6/M\u2299) < 11) have similar H\u03b4 absorption profiles in all environments, but show an indication of enhanced [OII] emission in intermediate-density environments. This indicates that field galaxies with low stellar mass and filament galaxies with high stellar mass are more likely to have experienced a recent burst of star formation, while galaxies of the intermediate stellar-mass show an increase of star formation at filament-like densities. We also find that the median [OII] equivalent width (|EW[OII]|) decreases from 27\u2005\u00b1\u20052 \u00c5 to 2.0+0.5\u22120.4 \u00c5 and Dn4000 increases from 1.09\u2005\u00b1\u20050.01 to 1.56\u2005\u00b1\u20050.03 with increasing stellar mass (from \u223c109.25 to \u223c1011.35\u2006M\u2299). For the dependence on the environment, we find that at fixed stellar mass, |EW[OII]| is tentatively lower in environments with higher density. We find for Dn4000 that the increase with stellar mass is sharper in denser environments, which indicates that these environments may accelerate galaxy evolution. Moreover, we find higher Dn4000 values in denser environments at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that galaxies are on average older and/or more metal rich in these dense environments. This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most massive galaxies have, on average, the lowest specific star formation rates and the oldest stellar populations (age \u2273 1 Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also hypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher EW[OII]|, higher specific star formation rate) at intermediate densities may lead to quenching because we find that the quenched fraction increases sharply from the filament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.",
"It is well known that reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveals a relationship between AGN luminosity and the size of the broad-line region, and that use of this relationship, combined with the Doppler width of the broad emission line, enables an estimate of the mass of the black hole at the center of the active nucleus based on a single spectrum. An unresolved key issue is the choice of parameter used to characterize the line width, either FWHM or line dispersion \n\n\n\n\n (the square root of the second moment of the line profile). We argue here that use of FWHM introduces a bias, stretching the mass scale such that high masses are overestimated and low masses are underestimated. Here we investigate estimation of black hole masses in AGNs based on individual or \u201csingle-epoch\u201d observations, with a particular emphasis in comparing mass estimates based on line dispersion and FWHM. We confirm the recent findings that, in addition to luminosity and line width, a third parameter is required to obtain accurate masses, and that parameter seems to be Eddington ratio. We present simplified empirical formulae for estimating black hole masses from the H\u03b2\n\u03bb4861 and C iv\n\u03bb1549 emission lines. While the AGN continuum luminosity at 5100 \u00c5 is usually used to predict the H\u03b2 reverberation lag, we show that the luminosity of the H\u03b2 broad component can be used instead without any loss of precision, thus eliminating the difficulty of accurately accounting for the host-galaxy contribution to the observed luminosity.",
"The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases, respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such a signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings, and tensor mode generation by the non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; and oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, for this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigated the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this would be the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.",
"The existence of \u223c109M\u2299supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of the Universe has stimulated numerous ideas for the prompt formation and rapid growth of black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Here, we review ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first assembled, how they may have subsequently grown as massive as \u223c109M\u2299, and how multimessenger observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly scenarios. We conclude the following: \u25aa\u2002 The ultrarare \u223c109M\u2299SMBHs represent only the tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely fill a continuum from the stellar-mass (\u223c10M\u2299) to the supermassive (\u223c109) regimes, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. \u25aa\u2002 Stellar-mass BHs were likely left behind by the first generation of stars at redshifts as high as \u223c30, but their initial growth typically was stunted due to the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. \u25aa\u2002 Conditions in some larger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and growth of massive seed holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense stellar clusters. \u25aa\u2002 BH masses depend on the environment (such as the number and properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic streaming velocity) and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy. \u25aa\u2002 Distinguishing between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a combination of observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (probing massive BH growth via mergers) and by deep multiwavelength electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas accretion) is particularly promising.",
"The intensity of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) derived from the magnetic field measurements by the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) is analyzed for the low solar activity period of July 2018\u2013April 2022. The CSES spacecraft flies in a Sun-synchronous orbit, providing the first continuous satellite observations of the afternoon EEJ at a fixed local time at 2 p.m. The EEJ intensities from CSES and concurrent observations from the Swarm satellite mission show a good correlation, supporting the reliability of the CSES EEJ data. Spectral analysis of the CSES data reveals the presence of three distinct oscillatory components in the day-to-day variation of the afternoon EEJ: (1) an eastward-propagating 2\u20133-day oscillation with zonal wavenumber 1, (2) a westward-propagating 5\u20136-day oscillation with zonal wavenumber 1, and (3) a zonally-symmetric 14\u201315-day oscillation. These oscillations result from upward-propagating waves in the atmosphere. That is, the first two can be attributed to the ultra-fast Kelvin wave and quasi-6-day wave, respectively, while the latter is likely due to the atmospheric lunar tide. The CSES EEJ data are also compared with lower thermospheric wind measurements by the Michelson Interferometer for Global High-Resolution Thermospheric Imaging (MIGHTI) onboard the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON). The results suggest that the EEJ intensity correlates negatively with the equatorial eastward wind at 100\u2013115 km, consistent with earlier studies. Contributions of different tidal wind components to longitudinal structures of the EEJ are evaluated. A four-peak structure during July\u2013September can be largely explained by the eastward-propagating diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber 3 (DE3), while a two- or three-peak structure during December\u2013January is mainly due to the combined effect of DE3 and the eastward-propagating diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber 2 (DE2). Furthermore, the CSES EEJ data are compared with the electron density measurements from the Langmuir probe onboard CSES. There is a positive correlation between the EEJ intensity and in-situ electron densities at \u223c510 km from the same orbit, reflecting the plasma fountain effect. The correlation tends to be higher in the summer hemisphere, which may be due to the meridional wind in the thermosphere.",
"Context. Many molecules observed in the interstellar medium are thought to result from the thermal desorption of ices. Parameters such as the desorption energy and pre-exponential frequency factor are essential in describing the desorption of molecules. Experimental determinations of these parameters are missing for many molecules, including those found in the interstellar medium.Aims. The objective of this work is to expand the number of molecules for which desorption parameters are available, by collecting and re-analysing experimental temperature programmed desorption data that are present in the literature.Methods. We used transition state theory (TST) in combination with the Redhead equation to determine the desorption parameters. Experimental data and molecular constants (e.g. mass, moment of inertia, etc.) were collected and given as input.Results. Using the Redhead-TST method, the desorption parameters for 133 molecules were determined. The Redhead-TST method is found to provide reliable results that agree well with desorption parameters determined on the basis of more rigorous experimental methods. The importance of using accurately determined pre-exponential frequency factors to simulate desorption profiles is highlighted here. The large amount of data allows us to look for trends, with the most important being the relationship log10(v) = 2.65ln(m) + 8.07, where \u03bd is the pre-exponential frequency factor and m is the mass of the molecule.Conclusions. The data collected in this work allow for the thermal desorption of molecules to be modeled, with the aim of helping improve our understanding of changes in the chemical and elemental composition of interstellar environments.",
"Context.This is the second paper of a series on Galactic OB groups that uses astrometric and photometric data fromGaiaand spectral classifications from the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS) and the Library of Libraries of Massive-star high-Resolution spectra (LiLiMaRlin). The previous paper was based on the secondGaiadata release (DR2). Since then, the early thirdGaiadata release (EDR3) has appeared with new astrometry and photometry.Aims.The two aims of this paper are to revise the results for the sample from Paper I usingGaiaEDR3 data and to expand the sample of analyzed stellar groups to 26, from Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-026.Methods.We used GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O stars and an updated version of the method in Paper 0 of this series, combiningGaiaEDR3 G +GBP+GRPphotometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign memberships and measure distances. We present 99 spectra from GOSSS and 32 from LiLiMaRlin for stars in the analyzed groups or in their foreground.Results.We derived distances to the 26 stellar groups with unprecedented precision and accuracy, with total (random plus systematic) uncertainties lower than 1% for distances within 1 kpc and of \u223c3% around 3 kpc, which are values almost four times better than forGaiaDR2. We provide homogeneous spectral types for 110 stars and correct a number of errors in the literature, especially for objects in Villafranca O-023 (Orion nebula cluster). For each group, we discuss its membership and present possible runaway and walkaway stars. At least two of the studied groups, Villafranca O-O12 S in NGC 2467 and Villafranca O-014 NW in the North America nebula, are orphan clusters in which the most massive stars have been ejected by dynamical interactions, leaving objects with a capped mass function. The existence of such clusters has important consequences for the study of the initial mass function (IMF), the distribution of supernova explosions across the Galaxy, and the population and dynamics of isolated compact objects. We fit pre-main-sequence (PMS) isochrones to the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of four clusters to derive ages of 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 Ma for Villafranca O-026 (\u03c3Orionis cluster), 4 \u00b1 2 Ma for Villafranca O-016 (NGC 2264), 5.0 \u00b1 0.5 Ma for Villafranca O-021 (NGC 2362), and 8 \u00b1 2 Ma for Villafranca O-024 (\u03b3Velorum cluster).",
"Context.Stellar flares cannot be spatially resolved, which complicates ascertaining the physical processes behind particular spectral signatures. Due to their proximity to Earth, solar flares can serve as a stepping stone for understanding their stellar counterparts, especially when using a Sun-as-a-star instrument and in combination with spatially resolved observations.Aims.We aim to understand the disk-integrated spectral behaviors of a confined X2.2 flare and its eruptive X9.3 successor, which had energies of 2.2\u2005\u00d7\u20051031erg and 9.3\u2005\u00d7\u20051031erg, respectively, as measured by Sun-as-a-star observations with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N).Methods.The behavior of multiple photospheric (NaD1&D2, Mg\u202fIat 5173 \u00c5, Fe\u202fIat 6173 \u00c5, and Mn\u202fIat 4031 \u00c5) and chromospheric (Ca\u202fIIH & K, H\u03b1, H\u03b2, and He\u202fID3) spectral lines were investigated by means of activity indices and contrast profiles. A number of different photospheric lines were also investigated by means of equivalent widths, and radial velocity measures, which were then related to physical processes directly observed in high-resolution observations made with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).Results.Our findings suggest a relationship between the evolving shapes of contrast profile time and the flare locations, which assists in constraining flare locations in disk-integrated observations. In addition, an upward bias was found in flare statistics based on activity indices derived from the Ca\u202fIIH & K lines. In this case, much smaller flares cause a similar increase in the activity index as that produced by larger flares. H\u03b1-based activity indices do not show this bias and are therefore less susceptible to activity jitter. Sodium line profiles show a strongly asymmetric response during flare activity, which is best captured with a newly defined asymmetrical sodium activity index. A strong flare response was detected in Mn\u202fIline profiles, which is unexpected and calls for further exploration. Intensity increases in H\u03b1, H\u03b2, and certain spectral windows of AIA before the flare onset suggest their potential use as short-term flare predictors.",
"Context.The spectral classifications of the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS) and the astrometric and photometric data fromGaiahave significantly improved our ability to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar groups (clusters, associations, or parts thereof) with OB stars. In the near future, the situation will be further improved thanks to subsequentGaiadata releases and new photometric and spectroscopic surveys.Aims.We initiated a program to identify and determine the membership of Galactic stellar groups with OB stars and measure distances to them. Given the data currently available, we started with the identification and distance determinations of groups with O stars. In this paper, we concentrate on groups that contain stars with the earliest spectral subtypes.Methods.We used GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O2\u2013O3.5 stars and the method described in paper 0 of this series, which combinesGaiaDR2G+GBP+GRPphotometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust memberships and measure distances. We also included Collinder 419 and NGC 2264, the clusters cited in that paper, to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic stellar groups.Results.We derived distances, determined the membership, and analyzed the structure of sixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-016, including the fourteen groups with the earliest-O-type optically accessible stars known in the Milky Way. We compared our distance with previous results from the literature and establish that the best consistency is with (the small number of) VLBI parallaxes and the worst is with kinematic distances. Our results indicate that very massive stars can form in relatively low-mass clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the Bajamar star in the North America nebula. This lends support to the hierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in well-defined bound clusters but others are born in associations that are unbound from the beginning: groups of newborn stars come in many shapes and sizes. We propose that HD 64 568 and HD 64 315 AB could have been ejected simultaneously from Haffner 18 (Villafranca O-012 S). Our results are consistent with a difference of \u224820\u03bcas in theGaiaDR2 parallax zero point between bright and faint stars.",
"The Gaia mission has provided an invaluable wealth of astrometric data for more than a billion stars in our Galaxy. The synergy between Gaia astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopic surveys gives us comprehensive information about the Milky Way. Using the Bayesian isochrone-fitting code StarHorse, we derive distances and extinctions for more than 10 million unique stars listed in both Gaia Data Release 3 and public spectroscopic surveys: 557 559 in GALAH+ DR3, 4 531 028 in LAMOST DR7 LRS, 347 535 in LAMOST DR7 MRS, 562 424 in APOGEE DR17, 471 490 in RAVE DR6, 249 991 in SDSS DR12 (optical spectra from BOSS and SEGUE), 67 562 in the Gaia-ESO DR5 survey, and 4 211 087 in the Gaia RVS part of the Gaia DR3 release. StarHorse can increase the precision of distance and extinction measurements where Gaia parallaxes alone would be uncertain. We used StarHorse for the first time to derive stellar ages for main-sequence turnoff and subgiant branch stars, around 2.5 million stars, with age uncertainties typically around 30%; the uncertainties drop to 15% for subgiant-branch-only stars, depending on the resolution of the survey. With the derived ages in hand, we investigated the chemical-age relations. In particular, the \u03b1 and neutron-capture element ratios versus age in the solar neighbourhood show trends similar to previous works, validating our ages. We used the chemical abundances from local subgiant samples of GALAH DR3, APOGEE DR17, and LAMOST MRS DR7 to map groups with similar chemical compositions and StarHorse ages, using the dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN. We identify three distinct groups in all three samples, confirmed by their kinematic properties: the genuine chemical thick disk, the thin disk, and a considerable number of young alpha-rich stars (427) that are also a part of the delivered catalogues. We confirm that the genuine thick disk\u2019s kinematics and age properties are radically different from those of the thin disk and compatible with high-redshift (z\u2004\u2248\u20042) star-forming disks with high dispersion velocities. We also find a few extra chemical populations in GALAH DR3 thanks to the availability of neutron-capture element information.",
" Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback. ",
"We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation\u2014turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity\u2014are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.",
"Double-peak narrow emission line galaxies have been studied extensively in the past years, in the hope of discovering late stages of mergers. It is difficult to disentangle this phenomenon from disc rotations and gas outflows with the sole spectroscopic measurement of the central 3\u2033. We aim to properly detect such galaxies and distinguish the underlying mechanisms with a detailed analysis of the host-galaxy properties and their kinematics. Relying on the Reference Catalogue of Spectral Energy Distribution, we developed an automated selection procedure and found 5663 double-peak emission line galaxies at z\u2004< \u20040.34 corresponding to 0.8% of the parent database. To characterise these galaxies, we built a single-peak no-bias control sample (NBCS) with the same redshift and stellar mass distributions as the double-peak sample (DPS). These two samples are indeed very similar in terms of absolute magnitude, [OIII] luminosity, colour-colour diagrams, age and specific star formation rate, metallicity, and environment. We find an important excess of S0 galaxies in the DPS, not observed in the NBCS, which cannot be accounted for by the environment, as most of these galaxies are isolated or in poor groups. Similarly, we find a relative deficit of pure discs in the DPS late-type galaxies, which are preferentially of Sa type. In parallel, we observe a systematic central excess of star formation and extinction for double peak (DP) galaxies. Finally, there are noticeable differences in the kinematics: The gas velocity dispersion is correlated with the galaxy inclination in the NBCS, whereas this relation does not hold for the DPS. Furthermore, the DP galaxies show larger stellar velocity dispersions and they deviate from the Tully-Fisher relation for both late-type and S0 galaxies. These discrepancies can be reconciled if one considers the two peaks as two different components. Considering the morphological biases in favour of bulge-dominated galaxies and the star formation central enhancement, we suggest a scenario of multiple, sequential minor mergers driving the increase of the bulge size, leading to larger fractions of S0 galaxies and a deficit of pure disc galaxies.",
"The discovery of large numbers of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over the past decade has made it possible to investigate star formation and early evolution in a previously unexplored mass regime. In this review, we begin by describing surveys for low-mass members of nearby associations, open clusters, star-forming regions, and the methods used to characterize their stellar properties. We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 The Local Group dwarf galaxies offer a unique window to the detailed properties of the most common type of galaxy in the Universe. In this review, I update the census of Local Group dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium (ISM), (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the \u201cdark matter problem\u201d and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing, and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and do not know about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.

"We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a pre-explosion counterpart to SN\u00a02019yvr obtained 2.6\u00a0yr before its explosion as a type Ib supernova (SN\u00a0Ib). Aligning to a post-explosion Gemini-S/GSAOI image, we demonstrate that there is a single source consistent with being the SN\u00a02019yvr progenitor system, the second SN\u00a0Ib progenitor candidate after iPTF13bvn. We also analysed pre-explosion Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging, but we do not detect any counterparts at the SN location. SN\u00a02019yvr was highly reddened, and comparing its spectra and photometry to those of other, less extinguished SNe\u00a0Ib we derive $E(B-V)=0.51\\substack{+0.27\\\\ -0.16}$\u00a0mag for SN\u00a02019yvr. Correcting photometry of the pre-explosion source for dust reddening, we determine that this source is consistent with a log\u2009(L/L\u2299) = 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 and $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 6800\\substack{+400\\\\ -200}$\u00a0K star. This relatively cool photospheric temperature implies a radius of 320$\\substack{+30\\\\ -50}~\\mathrm{ R}_{\\odot}$, much larger than expectations for SN\u00a0Ib progenitor stars with trace amounts of hydrogen but in agreement with previously identified SN\u00a0IIb progenitor systems. The photometry of the system is also consistent with binary star models that undergo common envelope evolution, leading to a primary star hydrogen envelope mass that is mostly depleted but still seemingly in conflict with the SN\u00a0Ib classification of SN\u00a02019yvr. SN\u00a02019yvr had signatures of strong circumstellar interaction in late-time (&gt;150\u00a0d) spectra and imaging, and so we consider eruptive mass-loss and common envelope evolution scenarios that explain the SN\u00a0Ib spectroscopic class, pre-explosion counterpart, and dense circumstellar material. We also hypothesize that the apparent inflation could be caused by a quasi-photosphere formed in an extended, low-density envelope, or circumstellar matter around the primary star.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is an empirically motivated modification of Newtonian gravity or inertia suggested by Milgrom as an alternative to cosmic dark matter. The basic idea is that at accelerations below ao\u2248 10\u22128cm/s2\u2248 cHo/6 the effective gravitational attraction approaches [Formula: see text], where gnis the usual Newtonian acceleration. This simple algorithm yields flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies and a mass-rotation velocity relation of the form M \u221d V4that forms the basis for the observed luminosity\u2013rotation velocity relation\u2014the Tully-Fisher law. We review the phenomenological success of MOND on scales ranging from dwarf spheroidal galaxies to superclusters and demonstrate that the evidence for dark matter can be equally well interpreted as evidence for MOND. We discuss the possible physical basis for an acceleration-based modification of Newtonian dynamics as well as the extention of MOND to cosmology and structure formation.",
"The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is a photometric survey that is poised to scan several thousands of square degrees of the sky. It will use 54 narrow-band filters, combining the benefits of low-resolution spectra and photometry. Its offshoot, miniJPAS, is a 1 deg2survey that uses J-PAS filter system with the Pathfinder camera. In this work, we study mJPC2470-1771, the most massive cluster detected in miniJPAS. We survey the stellar population properties of the members, their star formation rates (SFR), star formation histories (SFH), the emission line galaxy (ELG) population, spatial distribution of these properties, and the ensuing effects of the environment. This work shows the power of J-PAS to study the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We used a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code to derive the stellar population properties of the galaxy members: stellar mass, extinction, metallicity, (u\u2005\u2212\u2005r)resand (u\u2005\u2212\u2005r)intcolours, mass-weighted age, the SFH that is parametrised by a delayed-\u03c4model (\u03c4,t0), and SFRs. We used artificial neural networks for the identification of the ELG population via the detection of the H\u03b1, [NII], H\u03b2, and [OIII] nebular emission. We used the Ew(H\u03b1)-[NII] (WHAN) and [OIII]/H\u03b1-[NII]/H\u03b1(BPT) diagrams to separate them into individual star-forming galaxies and AGNs. We find that the fraction of red galaxies increases with the cluster-centric radius; and at 0.5R200the red and blue fractions are both equal. The redder, more metallic, and more massive galaxies tend to be inside the central part of the cluster, whereas blue, less metallic, and less massive galaxies are mainly located outside of the inner 0.5R200. We selected 49 ELG, with 65.3% of them likely to be star-forming galaxies, dominated by blue galaxies, and 24% likely to have an AGN (Seyfert or LINER galaxies). The rest are difficult to classify and are most likely composite galaxies. These latter galaxies are red, and their abundance decreases with the cluster-centric radius; in contrast, the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases outwards up toR200. Our results are compatible with an scenario in which galaxy members were formed roughly at the same epoch, but blue galaxies have had more recent star formation episodes, and they are quenching out from within the cluster centre. The spatial distribution of red galaxies and their properties suggest that they were quenched prior to the cluster accretion or an earlier cluster accretion epoch. AGN feedback or mass might also stand as an obstacle in the quenching of these galaxies.",
"Ensemble studies of red-giant stars with exquisite asteroseismic (Kepler), spectroscopic (APOGEE), and astrometric (Gaia) constraints offer a novel opportunity to recast and address long-standing questions concerning the evolution of stars and of the Galaxy. Here, we infer masses and ages for nearly 5400 giants with availableKeplerlight curves and APOGEE spectra using the codePARAM, and discuss some of the systematics that may affect the accuracy of the inferred stellar properties. We then present patterns in mass, evolutionary state, age, chemical abundance, and orbital parameters that we deem robust against the systematic uncertainties explored. First, we look at age-chemical-abundances ([Fe/H] and [\u03b1/Fe]) relations. We find a dearth of young, metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0.2) stars, and the existence of a significant population of old (8\u22129 Gyr), low-[\u03b1/Fe], super-solar metallicity stars, reminiscent of the age and metallicity of the well-studied open cluster NGC 6791. The age-chemo-kinematic properties of these stars indicate that efficient radial migration happens in the thin disc. We find that ages and masses of the nearly 400\u03b1-element-rich red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in our sample are compatible with those of an old (\u223c11 Gyr), nearly coeval, chemical-thick disc population. Using a statistical model, we show that the width of the observed age distribution is dominated by the random uncertainties on age, and that the spread of the inferred intrinsic age distribution is such that 95% of the population was born within \u223c1.5 Gyr. Moreover, we find a difference in the vertical velocity dispersion between low- and high-[\u03b1/Fe] populations. This discontinuity, together with the chemical one in the [\u03b1/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram, and with the inferred age distributions, not only confirms the different chemo-dynamical histories of the chemical-thick and thin discs, but it is also suggestive of a halt in the star formation (quenching) after the formation of the chemical-thick disc. We then exploit the almost coeval\u03b1-rich population to gain insight into processes that may have altered the mass of a star along its evolution, which are key to improving the mapping of the current, observed, stellar mass to the initial mass and thus to the age. Comparing the mass distribution of stars on the lower RGB (R\u2004< \u200411\u2006R\u2299) with those in the red clump (RC), we find evidence for a mean integrated RGB mass loss \u27e8\u0394M\u27e9 = 0.10\u2005\u00b1\u20050.02M\u2299. Finally, we find that the occurrence of massive (M\u2004\u2273\u20041.1\u2006M\u2299)\u03b1-rich stars is of the order of 5% on the RGB, and significantly higher in the RC, supporting the scenario in which most of these stars had undergone an interaction with a companion.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 ROSAT observations indicate that approximately half of all nearby groups of galaxies contain spatially extended X-ray emission. The radial extent of the X-ray emission is typically 50\u2013500 h\u22121100 kpc or approximately 10\u201350% of the virial radius of the group. Diffuse X-ray emission is generally restricted to groups that contain at least one early-type galaxy. X-ray spectroscopy suggests the emission mechanism is most likely a combination of thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission. This interpretation requires that the entire volume of groups be filled with a hot, low-density gas known as the intragroup medium. ROSAT and ASCA observations indicate that the temperature of the diffuse gas in groups ranges from approximately 0.3 keV to 2 keV. Higher temperature groups tend to follow the correlations found for rich clusters between X-ray luminosity, temperature, and velocity dispersion. However, groups with temperatures below approximately 1 keV appear to fall off the cluster LX-T relationship (and possibly the LX-\u03c3 and \u03c3-T cluster relationships, although evidence for these latter departures is at the present time not very strong). Deviations from the cluster LX-T relationship are consistent with preheating of the intragroup medium by an early generation of stars and supernovae.  There is now considerable evidence that most X-ray groups are real, physical systems and not chance superpositions or large-scale filaments viewed edge-on. Assuming the intragroup gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, X-ray observations can be used to estimate the masses of individual systems. ROSAT observations indicate that the typical mass of an X-ray group is \u223c1013 h\u22121100 M[Formula: see text] out to the radius to which X-ray emission is currently detected. The observed baryonic masses of groups are a small fraction of the X-ray determined masses, which implies that groups are dominated by dark matter. On scales of the virial radius, the dominant baryonic component in groups is likely the intragroup medium. ",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 A violent outflow of high-velocity gas is one of the first manifestations of the formation of a new star. Such outflows emerge bipolarly from the young object and involve amounts of energy similar to those involved in accretion processes. The youngest (proto-)stellar low-mass objects known to date (the Class 0 protostars) present a particularly efficient outflow activity, indicating that outflow and infall motions happen simultaneously and are closely linked since the very first stages of the star formation processes.  This article reviews the wealth of information being provided by large millimeter-wave telescopes and interferometers on the small-scale structure of molecular outflows, as well as the most recent theories about their origin. The observations of highly collimated CO outflows, extremely high velocity (EHV) flows, and molecular \u201cbullets\u201d are examined in detail, since they provide key information on the origin and propagation of outflows. The peculiar chemistry operating in the associated shocked molecular regions is discussed, highlighting the recent high-sensitivity observations of low-luminosity sources. The classification schemes and the properties of the driving sources of bipolar outflows are summarized with special attention devoted to the recently identified Class 0 protostars. All these issues are crucial for building a unified theory on the mass-loss phenomena in young stars. ",
"We present new neutral atomic carbon [C\u202fI] (3P1\u2004\u2192\u20043P0) mapping observations within the inner \u223c7 kpc and \u223c4 kpc of the disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321 at a spatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We combine these with the CO(2\u22121) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [C\u202fI] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC 1808, NGC 7469) with the aim of studying: (a) the spatial distributions of C\u202fI and CO emission; (b) the observed line ratio RC\u202fI/CO = I[C\u202fI](1\u22120)/ICO(2\u22121) as a function of various galactic properties; and (c) the abundance ratio of [C\u202fI/CO]. We find excellent spatial correspondence between C\u202fI and CO emission and nearly uniform RC\u202fI/CO \u223c 0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321. However, RC\u202fI/CO strongly varies from \u223c0.05 at the center of NGC 4321 to > 0.2\u2005\u2212\u20050.5 in NGC 1808\u2019s starbursting center and NGC 7469\u2019s center with an X-ray-luminous AGN. Meanwhile, RC\u202fI/CO does not obviously vary with \u27e8U\u27e9, which is in line with predictions from photodissociation-dominated region (PDR) models. We also find a mildly decreasing RC\u202fI/CO value with an increasing metallicity over 0.7\u2005\u2212\u20050.85\u2006Z\u2299, which is consistent with the literature. Assuming various typical interstellar medium (ISM) conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions, and strong starbursting environments, we calculated the (non)local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimated the [C\u202fI/CO] abundance ratio to be \u223c0.1 across the disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies. However, this abundance ratio likely experiences a substantial increase, up to \u223c1 and \u22731\u2005\u2212\u20055 in NGC 1808\u2019s starburst and NGC 7469\u2019s strong AGN environments, respectively. This result is in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry. Finally, we do not find robust evidence for a generally CO-dark-and-C\u202fI-bright gas in the disk areas we probed.",
"The difficulties of determining latitude and longitude under adverse weather conditions, when neither the Sun nor stars can be sighted, are well-known, and the advantages of a non-visual system of position finding which could operate through clouds or fog are too obvious to require emphasis.A Radio Sextant, which detects and locks-on to 8 mm. radiation from the Sun, has already been made and tested in America with reputedly excellent results. An analysis of both the theoretical and the practical design factors is given in the present paper, together with the results of successful experiments made in Great Britain.\n",
"Context. Planets form in circumstellar disks around pre-main-sequence stars. A key question is, how do the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks depend on stellar mass? Studies of circumstellar disks at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths around intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars have revealed disk structures such as cavities, gaps, and spiral arms. The Herbig Ae/Be stars represent an older population of intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars. Since these evolve toward the main sequence on timescales comparable to those of typical disk dissipation, a full picture of disk dispersal in intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars must include the intermediate-mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars.Aims. We seek to find the precursors of the Herbig Ae/Be stars in the solar vicinity within 500 pc from the Sun. We do this by creating an optically selected sample of IMTT stars from the literature, here defined as stars of masses 1.5 M\u2299\u2264 M*\u2264 5 M\u2299 and with a spectral type between F and K3.Methods. We used literature optical photometry (0.4\u20131.25 \u03bcm) and distances determined from Gaia DR2 parallax measurements together with Kurucz stellar model spectra to place the stars in a HR diagram. We employed Siess evolutionary tracks to identify IMTT stars from the literature and derived masses and ages. We used Spitzer spectra to classify the disks around the stars into Meeus Group I and Group II disks based on their [F30/F13.5] spectral index. We also examined the 10 \u03bcm silicate dust grain emission and identified emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). From this, we built a qualitative picture of the disks around the IMTT stars and compared this with available spatially resolved images at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths to confirm our classification.Results. We find 49 IMTT stars with infrared excess. The identified disks are similar to the older Herbig Ae/Be stars in disk geometries and silicate dust grain population. The detection frequency of PAHs is higher than from disks around lower mass T Tauri stars but less frequent than from Herbig Ae/Be disks. Spatially resolved images at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths suggest gaps, and spirals are also present around the younger precursors to the Herbig Ae/Be stars.Conclusions. Comparing the timescale of stellar evolution toward the main sequence and current models of protoplanetary disk evolution, the similarity between Herbig Ae/Be stars and the IMTT stars points toward an evolution of Group I and Group II disks that are disconnected and represent two different evolutionary paths.",
"Context. Magnetic fields are a key component in the main sequence evolution of low mass stars. Flares, energetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, are an unmistakable manifestation of magnetically driven emission. The occurrence rates and energy distributions of flares trace stellar characteristics such as mass and age. However, before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass relation requires proper calibration.Aims. This work sets out to quantify the flaring activity of independently age-dated main sequence stars for a broad range of spectral types using optical light curves obtained by the Kepler satellite.Methods. Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 \u223c80 day long light curves of 2111 open cluster members for flares using the open-source software packages K2SC to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2 light curves, and AltaiPony to search and characterize the flare candidates.Results. We confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open cluster members with ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M 67). We extended the mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars to mid-M dwarfs. We added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr old Ruprecht 147, and several hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters. We found that the flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following a power law relation with exponent \u03b1\u2004\u2248\u20041.84\u22122.39.Conclusions. We confirm that flaring rates decline with age, and decline faster for higher mass stars. Our results are in good agreement with most previous statistical flare studies. We find evidence that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1\u2013M2 dwarfs around the ages of the Hyades and Praesepe, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10 d, while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates and lower mass stars still resided in the saturated activity regime. We conclude that some discrepancies between our results and flare studies that used rotation periods for their age estimates could be explained by sample selection bias toward more active stars, but others may point to the limitations of using rotation as an age indicator without additional constraints from stellar activity.",
" Understanding massive stars is essential for a variety of branches of astronomy including galaxy and star cluster evolution, nucleosynthesis and supernovae, pulsars, and black holes. It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage.  I show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.

"This paper presents a review of ideas that interconnect astrochemistry and galactic dynamics. Since these two areas are vast and not recent, each one has already been covered separately by several reviews. After a general historical introduction, and a needed quick review of processes such as stellar nucleosynthesis that gives the base to understand the interstellar formation of simple chemical compounds (e.g., H2, CO, NH3, and H2O), we focus on a number of topics that are at the crossing of the two big areas, dynamics and astrochemistry. Astrochemistry is a flourishing field that intends to study the presence and formation of molecules as well as the influence of them on the structure, evolution, and dynamics of astronomical objects. The progress in the knowledge on the existence of new complex molecules and of their process of formation originates from the observational, experimental, and theoretical areas that compose the field. The interfacing areas include star formation, protoplanetary disks, the role of the spiral arms, and the chemical abundance gradients in the galactic disk. It often happens that the physical conditions in some regions of the interstellar medium are only revealed by means of molecular observations. To organize a rough classification of chemical evolution processes, we discuss about how astrochemistry can act in three different contexts, namely, the chemistry of the early universe, including external galaxies, star-forming regions, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and circumstellar envelopes. We mention that our research is stimulated by plans for instruments and projects, such as the ongoing Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA), which consists in the construction of a 12\u00a0m sub-mm radio telescope in the Andes. Thus, modern and new facilities can play a key role in new discoveries not only in astrochemistry but also in radio astronomy and related areas. Furthermore, the research on the origin of life is also a stimulating perspective.",
"Context. Relativistic electrons and magnetic fields permeate the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and manifest themselves as diffuse sources of synchrotron emission observable at radio wavelengths, namely radio halos and radio relics. Although there is broad consensus that the formation of these sources is connected to turbulence and shocks in the ICM, the details of the required particle acceleration, the strength and morphology of the magnetic field in the cluster volume, and the influence of other sources of high-energy particles are poorly known.Aims. Sufficiently large samples of radio halos and relics, which would allow us to examine the variation among the source population and pinpoint their commonalities and differences, are still missing. At present, due to the physical properties of the sources and the capabilities of existing facilities, large numbers of these sources are easiest to detect at low radio frequencies, where they shine brightly.Methods. We examined the low-frequency radio emission from all 309 clusters in the second catalog of Planck Sunyaev Zel\u2019dovich detected sources that lie within the 5634 deg2 covered by the Second Data Release of the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). We produced LOFAR images at different resolutions, with and without discrete sources subtracted, and created overlays with optical and X-ray images before classifying the diffuse sources in the ICM, guided by a decision tree.Results. Overall, we found 83 clusters that host a radio halo and 26 that host one or more radio relics (including candidates). About half of them are new discoveries. The detection rate of clusters that host a radio halo and one or more relics in our sample is 30\u2005\u00b1\u200511% and 10\u2005\u00b1\u20056%, respectively. Extrapolating these numbers, we anticipate that once LoTSS covers the entire northern sky it will provide the detection of 251\u2005\u00b1\u200592 clusters that host a halo and 83\u2005\u00b1\u200550 clusters that host at least one relic from Planck clusters alone. All images and results produced in this work are publicly available via the project website.",
"The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies varies both between galaxies and within them. For instance, early-type spiral galaxies have a red bulge surrounded by a bluer star-forming disk with H\u202fII regions within. When observing redshifted galaxies, a given photometric filter probes light at a bluer rest frame, and in relating the observed magnitudes to the rest frame of the filter, so-called k corrections are commonly applied to account for the relative dimming or brightening in addition to the pure distance effect. The amount of correction depends on the shape of the spectrum (SED), so different k corrections apply to galaxies of different spectral types. This is, however, only part of the story, since any galaxy with a spatially non-homogeneous SED will experience a spatially varying relative dimming or brightening as a function of observed wavelength. Also, the morphological appearance of galaxies will therefore change with redshift. For instance, an early spiral galaxy observed in the V band would show a prominent bulge at z\u2004=\u20040, whereas, if at redshift z\u2004\u223c\u20041, the V filter probes emission in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet where the bulge is faint and the disk relatively brighter, thus the galaxy may appear as bulgeless. One popular way of studying spatial variations in the stellar population and dust content of galaxies is the use of color maps. For star-forming galaxies that have an appreciable contribution from nebular emission (lines and continuum), an additional effect is that the shifting of strong features in or out of filters will result in a non-monotonous color evolution with redshift. Hence, unlike the effects of distance, cosmological surface brightness dimming, and gravitational lensing, which are all achromatic, the fact that most galaxies have a spatially varying SED leads to a chromatic surface brightness modulation (CMOD) with redshift. While the CMOD effects are in principle easy to grasp, they affect multicolor imaging surveys and photometric properties derived from such surveys in a complex fashion. Properties such as the bulge-to-disk ratio, S\u00e9rsic exponent, light concentration, asymmetry index and effective radius, radial color gradients, and stellar mass determinations from SED fitting will depend on the redshift, the filters employed, and the rest-frame 2D SED patterns in a galaxy and will bias results inferred on galaxy evolution across cosmic time (e.g., the evolution of the mass-size, bulge-supermassive black hole, and Tully-Fisher relation), and potentially also weak lensing, if these effects are not properly taken into account. In this article we quantify the CMOD effects for idealized galaxies built from spectral synthesis models and from galaxies with observed integral field spectroscopy, and we show that they are significant and should be taken into account in studies of resolved galaxy properties and their evolution with redshift.",
"Context. The classification of the minor bodies of the Solar System based on observables has been continuously developed and iterated over the past 40 yr. While prior iterations followed either the availability of large observational campaigns or new instrumental capabilities opening new observational dimensions, we see the opportunity to improve primarily upon the established methodology.Aims. We developed an iteration of the asteroid taxonomy which allows the classification of partial and complete observations (i.e. visible, near-infrared, and visible-near-infrared spectrometry) and which reintroduces the visual albedo into the classification observables. The resulting class assignments are given probabilistically, enabling the uncertainty of a classification to be quantified.Methods. We built the taxonomy based on 2983 observations of 2125 individual asteroids, representing an almost tenfold increase of sample size compared with the previous taxonomy. The asteroid classes are identified in a lower-dimensional representation of the observations using a mixture of common factor analysers model.Results. We identify 17 classes split into the three complexes C, M, and S, including the new Z-class for extremely-red objects in the main belt. The visual albedo information resolves the spectral degeneracy of the X-complex and establishes the P-class as part of the C-complex. We present a classification tool which computes probabilistic class assignments within this taxonomic scheme from asteroid observations, intrinsically accounting for degeneracies between classes based on the observed wavelength region. The taxonomic classifications of 6038 observations of 4526 individual asteroids are published.Conclusions. The ability to classify partial observations and the reintroduction of the visual albedo into the classification provide a taxonomy which is well suited for the current and future datasets of asteroid observations, in particular provided by the Gaia, MITHNEOS, NEO Surveyor, and SPHEREx surveys.",
" Extraterrestrial materials, including meteorites, interplanetary dust, and spacecraft-returned asteroidal and cometary samples, provide a record of the starting materials and early evolution of the Solar System. We review how laboratory analyses of these materials provide unique information, complementary to astronomical observations, about a wide variety of stellar, interstellar and protoplanetary processes. Presolar stardust grains retain the isotopic compositions of their stellar sources, mainly asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. They serve as direct probes of nucleosynthetic and dust formation processes in stars, galactic chemical evolution, and interstellar dust processing. Extinct radioactivities suggest that the Sun's birth environment was decoupled from average galactic nucleosynthesis for some tens to hundreds of Myr but was enriched in short-lived isotopes from massive stellar winds or explosions shortly before or during formation of the Solar System. Radiometric dating of meteorite components tells us about the timing and duration over which solar nebula solids were assembled into the building blocks of the planets. Components of the most primitive meteoritical materials provide further detailed constraints on the formation, processing, and transport of material and associated timescales in the Sun's protoplanetary disk as well as in other forming planetary systems.

" We review the properties and behavior of 20 X-ray binaries that contain a dynamically-confirmed black hole, 17 of which are transient systems. During the past decade, many of these transient sources were observed daily throughout the course of their typically year-long outburst cycles using the large-area timing detector aboard the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100\u2013450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin. ",

"Context.Infrared and (sub-)millimeter observations of disks around T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars point to a chemical differentiation, with a lower detection rate of molecules in disks around hotter stars.Aims.We aim to investigate the underlying causes of the chemical differentiation indicated by observations and perform a comparative study of the chemistry of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks. This is one of the first studies to compare the chemistry in the outer regions of these two types of disk.Methods.We developed a model to compute the chemical composition of a generic protoplanetary disk, with particular attention to the photochemistry, and applied it to a T Tauri and a Herbig Ae/Be disk. We compiled cross sections and computed photodissociation and photoionization rates at each location in the disk by solving the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiative transfer in a 1+1D approach using the Meudon PDR code and adopting observed stellar spectra.Results.The warmer disk temperatures and higher ultraviolet flux of Herbig stars compared to T Tauri stars induce some differences in the disk chemistry. In the hot inner regions, H2O, and simple organic molecules like C2H2, HCN, and CH4are predicted to be very abundant in T Tauri disks and even more in Herbig Ae/Be disks, in contrast with infrared observations that find a much lower detection rate of water and simple organics toward disks around hotter stars. In the outer regions, the model indicates that the molecules typically observed in disks, like HCN, CN, C2H, H2CO, CS, SO, and HCO+, do not have drastic abundance differences between T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks. Some species produced under the action of photochemistry, like C2H and CN, are predicted to have slightly lower abundances around Herbig Ae stars due to a narrowing of the photochemically active layer. Observations indeed suggest that these radicals are somewhat less abundant in Herbig Ae disks, although in any case, the inferred abundance differences are small, of a factor of a few at most. A clear chemical differentiation between both types of disks concerns ices. Owing to the warmer temperatures of Herbig Ae disks, one expects snow lines lying farther away from the star and a lower mass of ices compared to T Tauri disks.Conclusions.The global chemical behavior of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks is quite similar. The main differences are driven by the warmer temperatures of the latter, which result in a larger reservoir or water and simple organics in the inner regions and a lower mass of ices in the outer disk.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 This review emphasizes the mass loss processes that affect the fates of single stars with initial masses between one and nine solar masses. Just one epoch of mass loss has been clearly demonstrated to be important for these stars; that is the episode that ends their evolution up the asymptotic giant branch. Quite a clear picture of this evolutionary stage is emerging from current studies. Mass loss rates increase precipitously as stars evolve toward greater luminosity and radius and decreased effective temperature. As a result, empirical relationships between mass loss rates and stellar parameters are determined mostly by selection effects and tell us which stars are losing mass rather than how stars lose mass. After detailed theoretical models are found to match observational constraints, the models may be used to extrapolate to populations not available for study nearby, such as young stars with low metallicity. The fates of stars are found to depend on both their initial masses and their initial metallicities; a larger proportion of low-metallicity stars should end up with core masses reaching the Chandrasekhar limit, giving rise to Type 1.5 supernovae, and the remnant white dwarfs of low-Z populations will be both fewer and more massive than those in Population I. There are also clear indications that some stars lose one to several tenths of a solar mass during the helium core flash, but neither models nor observations reveal any details of this process yet. The observational and theoretical bases for a variety of mass loss formulae in current use are also reviewed in this article, and the relations are compared in a series of figures.",
"After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\u25aaThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\u25aaThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\u25aaThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n            Following a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\u25aaSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\u25aaWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n            Another order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO.

"Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) are special among their kind due to the profound structural changes that the central engine experiences at low accretion rates (\u2272 10\u22123 in Eddington units). The disappearance of the accretion disc \u2013 the blue bump \u2013 leaves behind a faint optical nuclear continuum whose nature has been largely debated. This is mainly due to serious limitations on the observational side imposed by the starlight contamination from the host galaxy and the absorption by hydrogen, preventing the detection of these weak nuclei in the infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) range. We addressed these challenges by combining multi-wavelength sub-arcsecond resolution observations \u2013 able to isolate the genuine nuclear continuum \u2013 with nebular lines in the mid-IR, which allowed us to indirectly probe the shape of the extreme UV continuum. We found that eight of the nearest prototype LLAGN are compatible with pure compact jet emission over more than ten orders of magnitude in frequency. This consists of self-absorbed synchrotron emission from radio to the UV plus the associated synchrotron self-Compton component dominating the emission in the UV to X-ray range. Additionally, the LLAGN continua show two particular characteristics when compared with the typical jet spectrum seen in radio galaxies: (i) a very steep spectral slope in the IR-to-optical/UV range (\u22123.7\u2004<\u2004\u03b10\u2004<\u2004\u22121.3; F\u03bd\u2004\u221d\u2004\u03bd\u03b10); and (ii) a very high turnover frequency (0.2\u201330\u2006THz; 1.3\u2006mm\u201310\u2006\u03bcm) that separates the optically thick radio emission from the optically thin continuum in the IR-to-optical/UV range. These attributes can be explained if the synchrotron continuum is mainly dominated by thermalised particles at the jet base or the corona with considerably high temperatures, whereas only a small fraction of the energy (\u223c20%) would be distributed along the high-energy power-law tail of accelerated particles. On the other hand, the nebular gas excitation in LLAGN is in agreement with photo-ionisation from inverse Compton radiation (\u03b1x\u2004\u223c\u2004\u22120.7), which would dominate the nuclear continuum shortwards of \u223c3000 \u00c5, albeit a possible contribution from low-velocity shocks (< 500\u2006km\u2006s\u22121) to the line excitation cannot be discarded. No sign of a standard hot accretion disc is seen in our sample of LLAGN, nevertheless, a weak cold disc (< 3000\u2006K) is detected at the nucleus of the Sombrero galaxy, though its contribution to the nebular gas excitation is negligible. Our results suggest that the continuum emission in LLAGN is dominated at all wavelengths by undeveloped jets, powered by a thermalised particle distribution with high energies, on average. This is in agreement with their compact morphology and their high turnover frequencies. This behaviour is similar to that observed in peaked-spectrum radio sources and also compact jets in quiescent black hole X-ray binaries. Nevertheless, the presence of extended jet emission at kiloparsec scales for some of the objects in the sample is indicative of past jet activity, suggesting that these nuclei may undergo a rejuvenation event after a more active phase that produced their extended jets. These results imply that the dominant channel for energy release in LLAGN is mainly kinetic via the jet, rather than the radiative one. This has important implications in the context of galaxy evolution, since LLAGN probably represent a major but underestimated source of kinetic feedback in galaxies.",
"Context. Accurate mock halo catalogues are indispensable data products for developing and validating cosmological inference pipelines. A major challenge in generating mock catalogues is modelling the halo or galaxy bias, which is the mapping from matter density to dark matter halos or observable galaxies. To this end, N-body codes produce state-of-the-art catalogues. However, generating large numbers of these N-body simulations for big volumes, especially if magnetohydrodynamics are included, requires significant computational time.Aims. We introduce and benchmark a differentiable and physics-informed neural network that can generate mock halo catalogues of comparable quality to those obtained from full N-body codes. The model design is computationally efficient for the training procedure and the production of large mock catalogue suites.Methods. We present a neural network, relying only on 18 to 34 trainable parameters, that produces halo catalogues from dark matter overdensity fields. The reduction in network weights was realised through incorporating symmetries motivated by first principles into our model architecture. We trained our model using dark-matter-only N-body simulations across different resolutions, redshifts, and mass bins. We validated the final mock catalogues by comparing them to N-body halo catalogues using different N-point correlation functions.Results. Our model produces mock halo catalogues consistent with the reference simulations, showing that this novel network is a promising way to generate mock data for upcoming wide-field surveys due to its computational efficiency. Moreover, we find that the network can be trained on approximate overdensity fields to reduce the computational cost further. We also present how the trained network parameters can be interpreted to give insights into the physics of structure formation. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of our model as well as more general requirements and pitfalls of approximate halo mock generation that became evident from this study.",
"We present a White Paper with a science theme concept of ocean world evolution and habitability proposed in response to ESA\u2019s Voyage 2050 Call with a focus on Titan and Enceladus in the Saturn system. Ocean worlds in the outer Solar System that possess subsurface liquid water oceans are considered to be prime targets for extra-terrestrial life and offer windows into Solar System evolution and habitability. The Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system (2004\u20132017) revealed Titan with its organic-rich evolving world with terrestrial features and Enceladus with its active aqueous environment to be ideal candidates to investigate ocean world evolution and habitability. Additionally, this White Paper presents a baseline for a multiple flyby mission with a focused payload as an example of how ocean world evolution and habitability in the Saturn system could be investigated building on the heritage of the Cassini-Huygens mission and complementing the recently selected NASA Dragonfly mission.",
"In Radio Super Novae (RSNe) a magnetic field of (B\u2009\u00d7\u2009r)\u2009=\u20091016.0\u00b10.12\u2009Gauss\u2009\u00d7\u2009cm is observed; these are the same numbers for Blue Super Giant (BSG) star explosions as for Red Super Giant (RSG) star explosions, despite their very different wind properties. The EHT data for M87 as well for low power radio galaxies all show consistency with just this value of the quantity (B\u2009\u00d7\u2009r), key for angular momentum and energy transport, and can be derived from the radio jet data. We interpret this as a property of the near surroundings of a black hole (BH) at near maximal rotation, independent of BH mass. In the commonly used green onion model, in which a 2\u2009\u03c0 flow changes over to a jet flow we interpret this as a wind emanating from the BH/accretion disk system and its surroundings. Near the BH collisions in the wind can produce a large fraction of anti-protons. In this scenario the cosmic Ray (CR) population from the wind/jet is proposed to be visible as EeV protons and anti-protons in the CR data to EeV energy, with a E\u22127/3 spectrum. This can be connected to a concept of inner and outer Penrose zones in the ergo-region. The observed numbers for the magnetic field imply the Planck time as the governing time scale: A BH rotating near maximum can accept a proton per log bin of energy in an extended spectrum with the associated pions every Planck time.",
"The Eigenvector 1 schema, or the main sequence of quasars, was introduced as an analogous scheme to the HR diagram that would allow us to understand the more complex, extended sources - active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that harbor accreting supermassive black holes. The study has spanned more than three decades and has advanced our knowledge of the diversity of Type-1 AGNs from both observational and theoretical aspects. The quasar main sequence, in its simplest form, is the plane between the FWHM of the broad H\u03b2emission line and the strength of the optical Feiiemission to the H\u03b2. While the former allows the estimation of the black hole mass, the latter enables direct measurement of the metal content and traces the accretion rate of the AGN. Together, they allow us to track the evolution of AGN in terms of the activity of the central nuclei, its effect on the line-emitting regions surrounding the AGN, and their diversity making them suitable distance indicators to study the expansion of our Universe. This mini-review aims to provide (i) a brief history leading up to the present day in the study of the quasar main sequence, (ii) introduce us to the many possibilities to study AGNs with the main sequence as a guiding tool, and (iii) highlight some recent, exciting lines of researches at the frontier of this ever-growing field.",
"Cometary nuclei contain the least modified material from the formative epoch of our planetary system, and their compositions reflect a range of processes experienced by material prior to its incorporation in the cometary nucleus. Dynamical models suggest that icy bodies in the main cometary reservoirs (Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud) formed in a range of environments in the protoplanetary disk, and (for the Oort Cloud) even in disks surrounding neighboring stars of the Sun's birth cluster. Photometric and spectroscopic surveys of more than 100 comets have enabled taxonomic groupings based on free radical species and on crystallinity of rocky grains. Since 1985, new surveys have provided emerging taxonomies based on the abundance ratios of primary volatiles. More than 20 primary chemical species are now detected in bright comets. Measurements of nuclear spin ratios (in water, ammonia, and methane) and of isotopic ratios (D/H in water and HCN;14N/15N in CN and HCN) have provided critical insights on factors affecting formation of the primary species. The identification of an abundant product species (HNC) has provided clear evidence of chemical production in the inner coma. Parallel advances have occurred in astrochemistry of hot corinos, circumstellar disks, and dense cloud cores. In this review, we address the current state of cometary taxonomy and compare it with current astrochemical insights.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Interstellar turbulence has implications for the dispersal and mixing of the elements, cloud chemistry, cosmic ray scattering, and radio wave propagation through the ionized medium. This review discusses the observations and theory of these effects. Metallicity fluctuations are summarized, and the theory of turbulent transport of passive tracers is reviewed. Modeling methods, turbulent concentration of dust grains, and the turbulent washout of radial abundance gradients are discussed. Interstellar chemistry is affected by turbulent transport of various species between environments with different physical properties and by turbulent heating in shocks, vortical dissipation regions, and local regions of enhanced ambipolar diffusion. Cosmic rays are scattered and accelerated in turbulent magnetic waves and shocks, and they generate turbulence on the scale of their gyroradii. Radio wave scintillation is an important diagnostic for small-scale turbulence in the ionized medium, giving information about the power spectrum and amplitude of fluctuations. The theory of diffraction and refraction as well as the main observations and scintillation regions are reviewed.",
"The tight radial acceleration relation (RAR) obeyed by rotationally supported disk galaxies is one of the most successful a priori predictions of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm on galaxy scales. Another important consequence of MOND as a classical modification of gravity is that the strong equivalence principle (SEP) \u2013 which requires the dynamics of a small, free-falling, self-gravitating system not to depend on the external gravitational field in which it is embedded \u2013 should be broken. Multiple tentative detections of this so-called external field effect (EFE) of MOND have been made in the past, but the systems that should be most sensitive to it are galaxies with low internal gravitational accelerations residing in galaxy clusters within a strong external field. Here, we show that ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster do lie on the RAR, and that their velocity dispersion profiles are in full agreement with isolated MOND predictions, especially when including some degree of radial anisotropy. However, including a breaking of the SEP via the EFE seriously deteriorates this agreement. We discuss various possibilities to explain this within the context of MOND, including a combination of tidal heating and higher baryonic masses. We also speculate that our results could mean that the EFE is screened in cluster UDGs. The fact that this would happen precisely within galaxy clusters, where classical MOND fails, could be especially relevant to the nature of the residual MOND missing mass in clusters of galaxies.",
"Context. The formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks remains elusive. We have numerous astronomical observations of young stellar objects of different ages with their envelopes and/or disks. Moreover, in the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in numerical simulations of star and disk formation. New simulations use realistic equations of state for the gas and treat the interaction of matter and the magnetic field with the full set of nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. However, it is still not fully clear how a disk forms and whether it happens from inside-out or outside-in. Open questions remain regarding where material is accreted onto the disk and comes from, how dust evolves in disks, and the timescales of appearance of disk\u2019s structures. These unknowns limit our understanding of how planetesimals and planets form and evolve.Aims. We attempted to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the protosolar disk, guided by the large amount of cosmochemical constraints derived from the study of meteorites, while using astronomical observations and numerical simulations as a guide to pinpointing plausible scenarios.Methods. Our approach is highly interdisciplinary and we do not present new observations or simulations in this work. Instead, we combine, in an original manner, a large number of published results concerning young stellar objects observations, and numerical simulations, along with the chemical, isotopic and petrological nature of meteorites.Results. We have achieved a plausible and coherent view of the evolution of the protosolar disk that is consistent with cosmochemical constraints and compatible with observations of other protoplanetary disks and sophisticated numerical simulations. The evidence that high-temperature condensates, namely, calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs), formed near the protosun before being transported to the outer disk can be explained in two ways: there could have either been an early phase of vigorous radial spreading of the disk that occurred or fast transport of these condensates from the vicinity of the protosun toward large disk radii via the protostellar outflow. The assumption that the material accreted toward the end of the infall phase was isotopically distinct allows us to explain the observed dichotomy in nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies of meteorites. It leads us toward intriguing predictions on the possible isotopic composition of refractory elements in comets. At a later time, when the infall of material waned, the disk started to evolve as an accretion disk. Initially, dust drifted inward, shrinking the radius of the dust component to \u223c45 au, probably about to about half of the width of the gas component. Next, structures must have emerged, producing a series of pressure maxima in the disk, which trapped the dust on Myr timescales. This allowed planetesimals to form at radically distinct times without significantly changing any of the isotopic properties. We also conclude that there was no late accretion of material onto the disk via streamers. The disk disappeared at about 5 My, as indicated by paleomagnetic data in meteorites.Conclusions. The evolution of the protosolar disk seems to have been quite typical in terms of size, lifetime, and dust behavior. This suggests that the peculiarities of the Solar System with respect to extrasolar planetary systems probably originate from the chaotic nature of planet formation and not from the properties of the parental disk itself.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Observations of parsec-scale radio jets associated with active galactic nuclei are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on high-luminosity core-dominated sources where the most detailed information on individual objects exists. Extensive imaging surveys with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have made possible a morphologic classification of compact radio sources and systematic studies of the statistics of apparent (often faster-than-light) motions found in an increasing number of sources. VLBI monitoring studies at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths, enhanced by spectral and polarization imaging, of representative types of AGN can discriminate detailed physical models. The observations are especially discussed in light of the variant of the relativistic beaming model that explains kinematic, spectral, and polarization properties of parsec-scale jets through shocks in an underlying continuous jet flow.",
"We present a multiline survey of the interstellar medium (ISM) in twoz\u2004>\u20046 quasar host galaxies, PJ231\u221220 (z\u2004=\u20046.59) and PJ308\u221221 (z\u2004=\u20046.23), and their two companion galaxies. Observations were carried out using the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA). We targeted 11 transitions including atomic fine-structure lines (FSLs) and molecular lines: [NII]205\u2006\u03bcm, [CI]369\u2006\u03bcm, CO (Jup\u2004=\u20047,\u200610,\u200615,\u200616), H2O 312\u2005\u2212\u2005221, 321\u2005\u2212\u2005312, 303\u2005\u2212\u2005212, and the OH163\u2006\u03bcmdoublet. The underlying far-infrared (FIR) continuum samples the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the respective dust emission. By combining this information with our earlier ALMA [CII]158\u2006\u03bcmobservations, we explored the effects of star formation and black hole feedback on the ISM of the galaxies using the CLOUDY radiative transfer models. We estimated dust masses, spectral indexes, IR luminosities, and star-formation rates from the FIR continuum. The analysis of the FSLs indicates that the [CII]158\u2006\u03bcmand [CI]369\u2006\u03bcmemission arises predominantly from the neutral medium in photodissociation regions (PDRs). We find that line deficits agree with those of local luminous IR galaxies. The CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) reveal significant high-JCO excitation in both quasar hosts. Our CO SLED modeling of the quasar PJ231\u221220 shows that PDRs dominate the molecular mass and CO luminosities forJup\u2004\u2264\u20047, while theJup\u2004\u2265\u200410 CO emission is likely driven by X-ray dissociation regions produced by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) at the very center of the quasar host. TheJup\u2004>\u200410 lines are undetected in the other galaxies in our study. The H2O 321\u2005\u2212\u2005312line detection in the same quasar places this object on theLH2O\u2005\u2212\u2005LTIRrelation found for low-zsources, thus suggesting that this water vapor transition is predominantly excited by IR pumping. Models of the H2O SLED and of the H2O-to-OH163\u2006\u03bcmratio point to PDR contributions with high volume and column density (nH\u2004\u223c\u20040.8\u2005\u00d7\u2005105cm\u22123,NH\u2004=\u20041024cm\u22122) in an intense radiation field. Our analysis suggests a less highly excited medium in the companion galaxies. However, the current data do not allow us to definitively rule out an AGN in these sources, as suggested by previous studies of the same objects. This work demonstrates the power of multiline studies of FIR diagnostics in order to dissect the physical conditions in the first massive galaxies emerging from cosmic dawn.",
"We study the impact of local density and stellar mass on the structure and morphology of approximately 500 quiescent and star-forming galaxies from the VIMOS Spectroscopic Survey of a Superstructure in COSMOS (VIS3COS). We perform bulge-to-disc decomposition of the surface brightness profiles and find \u223c41\u2005\u00b1\u20053% of > 1010\u2006M\u2299 galaxies to be best fitted with two components. We complement our analysis with non-parametric morphological measurements and qualitative visual classifications. We find that both galaxy structure and morphology depend on stellar mass and environment for our sample as a whole. We only find an impact of the environment on galaxy size for galaxies more massive than 1011\u2006M\u2299. We find higher S\u00e9rsic indices (n) and bulge-to-total ratios (B/T) in high-density regions when compared to low-density counterparts at similar stellar masses. We also find that galaxies with higher stellar mass have steeper light profiles (high n, B/T) compared to galaxies with lower stellar mass. Using visual classifications, we find a morphology\u2013density relation at z\u2004\u223c\u20040.84 for galaxies more massive than 1010\u2006M\u2299, with elliptical galaxies being dominant at high-density regions and disc galaxies more common in low-density regions. However, when splitting the sample into colour\u2013colour-selected star-forming and quiescent sub-populations, there are no statistically significant differences between low- and high-density regions. We find that quiescent galaxies are smaller, have higher S\u00e9rsic indices (for single profiles, around n\u2004\u223c\u20044), and higher bulge-to-total light ratios (for decomposed profiles, around B/T\u2004\u223c\u20040.5) when compared to star-forming counterparts (n\u2004\u223c\u20041 and B/T\u2004\u223c\u20040.3, for single and double profiles, respectively). We confirm these trends with non-parametric quantities, finding quiescent galaxies to be smoother (lower asymmetry, lower M20) and to have most of their light over smaller areas (higher concentration and Gini coefficient) than star-forming galaxies. Overall, we find a stronger dependence of structure and morphology on stellar mass than on local density and these relations are strongly correlated with the quenching fraction. The change in average structure or morphology corresponds to a change in the relative fractions of blue disc-like galaxies and red elliptical galaxies with stellar mass and environment. We hypothesise that the processes responsible for the quenching of star formation must also affect the galaxy morphology on similar timescales.",
"The basic geometry of the Solar System\u2014the shapes, spacings, and orientations of the planetary orbits\u2014has long been a subject of fascination as well as inspiration for planet-formation theories. For exoplanetary systems, those same properties have only recently come into focus. Here we review our current knowledge of the occurrence of planets around other stars, their orbital distances and eccentricities, the orbital spacings and mutual inclinations in multiplanet systems, the orientation of the host star's rotation axis, and the properties of planets in binary-star systems.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Observations of damped Ly\u03b1 systems offer a unique window on the neutral-gas reservoirs that gave rise to galaxies at high redshifts. This review focuses on critical properties such as the H I and metal content of the gas and on independent evidence for star formation. Together, these provide an emerging picture of gravitationally bound objects in which accretion of gas from the IGM replenishes gas consumed by star formation. Other properties such as dust content, molecular content, ionized-gas content, gas kinematics, and galaxy identifications are also reviewed. These properties point to a multiphase ISM in which radiative and hydrodynamic feedback processes are present. Numerical simulations and other types of models used to describe damped Ly\u03b1 systems within the context of galaxy formation are also discussed. ",
"A review of the instruments and techniques to directly measure the full distributions of the cold-ion and cold-electron populations in the magnetosphere is presented. Relatively few studies have focused on the cold plasma populations of the magnetosphere due to difficulties associated with obtaining measurements. The cold particle populations are defined here as those with total energy approximately &lt;100\u00a0eV which is an energy range for which measurements are difficult (regardless of species), but which often make up the bulk of the plasma density. These populations have known and suspected impacts on the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere but to date have not yet been measured adequately. The lack of accurate measurements cold ion and electron populations through the magnetosphere makes closure of these science questions extremely difficult if not impossible. Reaching closure will require innovations in plasma spectrometers and associated techniques required to obtain high-fidelity measurements of the cold ion and electron populations in the magnetosphere. This paper seeks to review the instruments and techniques that have been used to date and present possible options for future missions.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 The Orion Nebula (M 42) is one of the best studied objects in the sky. The advent of multi-wavelength investigations and quantitative high resolution imaging has produced a rapid improvement in our knowledge of what is widely considered the prototype H II region and young galactic cluster. Perhaps uniquely among this class of object, we have a good three dimensional picture of the nebula, which is a thin blister of ionized gas on the front of a giant molecular cloud, and the extremely dense associated cluster. The same processes that produce the nebula also render visible the circumstellar material surrounding many of the pre\u2013main sequence low mass stars, while other circumstellar clouds are seen in silhouette against the nebula. The process of photoevaporation of ionized gas not only determines the structure of the nebula that we see, but is also destroying the circumstellar clouds, presenting a fundamental conundrum about why these clouds still exist.

"Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are ideal probes of the Universe at high redshift (\u0240), pinpointing the locations of the earliest star-forming galaxies and providing bright backlights with simple featureless power-law spectra that can be used to spectrally fingerprint the intergalactic medium and host galaxy during the period of reionization. Future missions such as Gamow Explorer (hereafter Gamow) are being proposed to unlock this potential by increasing the rate of identification of high-\u0240 (\u0240 > 5) GRBs in order to rapidly trigger observations from 6 to 10 m ground telescopes, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).Aims. Gamow was proposed to the NASA 2021 Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) program as a fast-slewing satellite featuring a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray telescope (LEXT) to detect and localize GRBs with arcminute accuracy, and a narrow-field multi-channel photo-\u0240 infrared telescope (PIRT) to measure their photometric redshifts for > 80% of the LEXT detections using the Lyman-\u03b1 dropout technique. We use a large sample of observed GRB afterglows to derive the PIRT sensitivity requirement.Methods. We compiled a complete sample of GRB optical\u2013near-infrared (optical-NIR) afterglows from 2008 to 2021, adding a total of 66 new afterglows to our earlier sample, including all known high-\u0240 GRB afterglows. This sample is expanded with over 2837 unpublished data points for 40 of these GRBs. We performed full light-curve and spectral-energy-distribution analyses of these after-glows to derive their true luminosity at very early times. We compared the high-\u0240 sample to the comparison sample at lower redshifts. For all the light curves, where possible, we determined the brightness at the time of the initial finding chart of Gamow, at different high redshifts and in different NIR bands. This was validated using a theoretical approach to predicting the afterglow brightness. We then followed the evolution of the luminosity to predict requirements for ground- and space-based follow-up. Finally, we discuss the potential biases between known GRB afterglow samples and those to be detected by Gamow.Results. We find that the luminosity distribution of high-\u0240 GRB afterglows is comparable to those at lower redshift, and we therefore are able to use the afterglows of lower-\u0240 GRBs as proxies for those at high \u0240. We find that a PIRT sensitivity of 15 \u00b5Jy (21 mag AB) in a 500 s exposure simultaneously in five NIR bands within 1000 s of the GRB trigger will meet the Gamow mission requirements. Depending on the \u0240 and NIR band, we find that between 75% and 85% of all afterglows at \u0240 > 5 will be recovered by Gamow at 5\u03c3 detection significance, allowing the determination of a robust photo-\u0240. As a check for possible observational biases and selection effects, we compared the results with those obtained through population-synthesis models, and find them to be consistent.Conclusions. Gamow and other high-\u0240 GRB missions will be capable of using a relatively modest 0.3 m onboard NIR photo-\u0240 telescope to rapidly identify and report high-\u0240 GRBs for further follow-up by larger facilities, opening a new window onto the era of reionization and the high-redshift Universe.",
"Local metal-poor galaxies stand as ideal laboratories for probing the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in chemically unevolved conditions. Detailed studies of this primitive ISM can help gain insights into the physics of the first primordial galaxies that may be responsible for the reionization. Quantifying the ISM porosity to ionizing photons in nearby galaxies may improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to Lyman continuum photon leakage from galaxies. The wealth of infrared (IR) tracers available in local galaxies and arising from different ISM phases allows us to constrain complex models in order to estimate physical quantities.",

"This is a pedagogical review on primordial non\u2010Gaussianities from inflation models. We introduce formalisms and techniques that are used to compute such quantities. We review different mechanisms which can generate observable large non\u2010Gaussianities during inflation, and distinctive signatures they leave on the non\u2010Gaussian profiles. They are potentially powerful probes to the dynamics of inflation. We also provide a nontechnical and qualitative summary of the main results and underlying physics.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The physical conditions in molecular clouds control the nature and rate of star formation, with consequences for planet formation and galaxy evolution. The focus of this review is on the conditions that characterize regions of star formation in our Galaxy. A review of the tools and tracers for probing physical conditions includes summaries of generally applicable results. Further discussion distinguishes between the formation of low-mass stars in relative isolation and formation in a clustered environment. Evolutionary scenarios and theoretical predictions are more developed for isolated star formation, and observational tests are beginning to interact strongly with the theory. Observers have identified dense cores collapsing to form individual stars or binaries, and analysis of some of these cores support theoretical models of collapse. Stars of both low and high mass form in clustered environments, but massive stars form almost exclusively in clusters. The theoretical understanding of such regions is considerably less developed, but observations are providing the ground rules within which theory must operate. The richest and most massive star clusters form in massive, dense, turbulent cores, which provide models for star formation in other galaxies.",
"Today's sensitive X-ray observations allow the study of populations of X-ray binaries in galaxies as distant as 20\u201330 Mpc. Photometric diagrams and luminosity functions applied to these populations provide a direct probe of the evolved binary component of different stellar populations. The study of the X-ray populations of E and S0 galaxies has revamped the debate on the formation and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and on the role of globular clusters in these processes. Though overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old stellar populations, the amount of sources in star-forming galaxies is related to the star-formation rate. Short-lived, luminous, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) dominate these young X-ray populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the debated ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Observations of the deep X-ray sky, and comparison with deep optical surveys, are providing the first evidence of the X-ray evolution of galaxies.",
"Context. In the hierarchical two-phase formation scenario, the halos of early type galaxies (ETGs) are expected to have different physical properties from the galaxies\u2019 central regions.Aims. The ePN.S survey characterizes the kinematic properties of ETG halos using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers, overcoming the limitations of absorption line spectroscopy at low surface brightness.Methods. We present two-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion fields for 33 ETGs, including fast (FRs) and slow rotators (SRs). The velocity fields were reconstructed from the measured PN velocities using an adaptive kernel procedure validated with simulations, and extend to a median of 5.6 effective radii (Re). We complemented the PN kinematics with absorption line data from the literature, for a complete description of the kinematics from the center to the outskirts.Results. ETGs typically show a kinematic transition between inner regions and halo. Estimated transition radii in units of Re anti-correlate with stellar mass. SRs have increased but still modest rotational support at large radii. Most of the FRs show a decrease in rotation, due to the fading of the inner disk in the outer, more slowly rotating spheroid. 30% of the FRs are dominated by rotation also at large radii. Most ETGs have flat or slightly falling halo velocity dispersion profiles, but 15% of the sample have steeply falling profiles. All of the SRs and 40% of the FRs show signatures of triaxial halos such as kinematic twists or misalignments. We show with illustrative photometric models that this is consistent with the distribution of isophote twists from extended photometry.Conclusions. ETGs have more diverse kinematic properties in their halos than in the central regions. FRs do contain inner disk components but these frequently fade in outer spheroids which are often triaxial. The observed kinematic transition to the halo and its dependence on stellar mass is consistent with \u039bCDM simulations and supports a two-phase formation scenario.",
"We present detailed chemical abundance measurements for 45 globular clusters (GCs) associated with galaxies in (and, in one case, beyond) the Local Group. The measurements are based on new high-resolution integrated-light spectra of GCs in the galaxies NGC 185, NGC 205, M 31, M 33, and NGC 2403, combined with reanalysis of previously published observations of GCs in the Fornax dSph, WLM, NGC 147, NGC 6822, and the Milky Way. The GCs cover the range \u22122.8\u2004<\u2004[Fe/H]\u2004<\u2004\u22120.1 and we determined abundances for Fe, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Ba, and Eu. Corrections for non local thermodynamic equilibrium effects are included for Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ba, building on a recently developed procedure. For several of the galaxies, our measurements provide the first quantitative constraints on the detailed composition of their metal-poor stellar populations. Overall, the GCs in different galaxies exhibit remarkably uniform abundance patterns of the \u03b1, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements, with a dispersion of less than 0.1 dex in [\u03b1/Fe] for the full sample. There is a hint that GCs in dwarf galaxies are slightly less \u03b1-enhanced (by \u223c0.04 dex on average) than those in larger galaxies. One GC in M 33 (HM33-B) resembles the most metal-rich GCs in the Fornax dSph (Fornax 4) and NGC 6822 (SC7) by having \u03b1-element abundances closer to scaled-solar values, possibly hinting at an accretion origin. A principal components analysis shows that the \u03b1-element abundances strongly correlate with those of Na, Sc, Ni, and Zn. Several GCs with [Fe/H]\u2004<\u2004\u22121.5 are deficient in Mg compared to other \u03b1-elements. We find no GCs with strongly enhanced r-process abundances as reported for metal-poor stars in some ultra-faint dwarfs and the Magellanic Clouds. The similarity of the abundance patterns for metal-poor GCs in different environments points to similar early enrichment histories and only allow for minor variations in the initial mass function.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Absolute magnitudes are estimated for carbon stars of various subtypes in the Hipparcos catalogue and as found in the Magellanic Clouds. Stellar radii fall within the limits of 2.4\u20134.7 AU. The chemical composition of carbon stars indicates that the C-N stars show nearly solar C/H, N/H, and 12C/13C ratios. This indicates that much of the C and N in our Galaxy came from mass-losing carbon stars. Special carbon stars such as the C-R, C-H, and dC stars are described.  Mass loss from asymptotic giant branch carbon stars, at rates up to several \u00d7 10\u22125 M[Formula: see text] year\u22121, contributes about half of the total mass return to the interstellar medium. R stars do not lose mass and may be carbon-rich red giants. The mass loss rates for Miras are about 10 times higher than for SRb and Lb stars, whose properties are similar enough to show that they are likely to belong to the same population. The distribution of carbon star mass loss rates peaks at about 10\u22127 M[Formula: see text] year\u22121, close to the rate of growth of the core mass and demonstrative of the close relationship between mass loss and evolution. Infrared spectroscopy shows that dust mixtures can occur. Detached shells are seen around some stars; they appear to form on the time scales of the helium shell flashes and to be a normal occurrence in carbon star evolution. ",
"We know little about the outermost exoplanets in planetary systems because our detection methods are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits. However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet population because dynamical modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing planets. We use four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178 debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH, and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys. Similar analyses are often conducted for individual discs, but we consider a large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the population of wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting these planets in the near future. We show that a \u2018typical\u2019 cold debris disc likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10\u2013100 au, with some needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently undetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should reveal many such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be perturbing debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred to be forming in protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed planets do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young planets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the responsible planets are more massive (and located farther inwards) than debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution modelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having unreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs. Finally, we provide catalogues of planet predictions and identify promising targets for future planet searches.",
"Context. Massive black holes (MBHs) are typically hosted in the centres of massive galaxies but they appear to become rarer in lower mass galaxies, where nuclear star clusters (NSCs) frequently appear instead. The transition region, where both an MBH and NSC can co-exist, has been poorly studied to date and only a few dozen galaxies are known to host them. One avenue for detecting new galaxies with both an MBH and NSC is to look for accretion signatures of MBHs.Aims. Here, we use new SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey eRASS:4 data to search for X-ray signatures of accreting MBHs in NSCs, while also investigating their combined occupation fraction.Methods. We collected more than 200 galaxies containing an NSC, spanning multiple orders in terms of galaxy stellar mass and morphological type, within the footprint of the German eROSITA Consortium survey. We determined the expected X-ray contamination from binary stellar systems using the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate as estimated from far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared emission.Results. We find significant detections for 18 galaxies (~8.3%), including one ultra-luminous X-ray source; however, only three galaxies (NGC 2903, 4212, and 4639) have X-ray luminosities that are higher than the expected value from X-ray binaries, indicative of the presence of an MBH. In addition, the X-ray luminosity of six galaxies (NGC 2903, 3384, 4321, 4365, 4639, and 4701) differs from previous studies and could indicate the presence of a variable active galactic nucleus. For NGC 4701 specifically, we find a variation of X-ray flux within the eRASS:4 data set. Stacking X-ray non-detected galaxies in the dwarf regimeM*gal\u2264 109M\u2299) results in luminosity upper limits of a few times 1038erg s\u22121. The combined occupation fraction of accreting MBHs and NSCs becomes non-zero for galaxy masses above ~ 107.5M\u2299and this result is slightly elevated as compared to the literature data.Conclusions. Our data extend, for the first time, towards the dwarf elliptical galaxy regime and identify promising MBH candidates for higher resolution follow-up observations. At most galaxy masses (and with the exception of three cases), the X-ray constraints are consistent with the expected emission from binary systems or an Eddington fraction of at most 0.01%, assuming a black holes mass of 106.5M\u2299. This work confirms the known complexities in similar-type of studies, while providing the appealing alternative of using X-ray survey data of in-depth observations of individual targets with higher resolution instruments.",
"Context. Great strides have been made in recent years in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Despite this, many observational findings have not yet been corroborated by astrophysical explanations. A fine contribution to the study of planetary formation processes comes from the study of young, low-mass planets, with short orbital periods (<100 days). In the last three years, the NASA/TESS satellite has identified many planets of this kind and their characterization is clearly necessary in order to understand how they formed and evolved.Aims. Within the framework of the Global Architecture of Planetary System (GAPS) project, we performed a validation and characterization (radius and mass) of the ultra-short period planet TOI-1807 b, which orbits its young host star BD+39 2643 (~300 Myr) in only 13 h. This is the youngest ultra-short period planet discovered so far.Methods. Thanks to a joint modeling of the stellar activity and planetary signals in the TESS light curve and in new HARPS-N radial-velocity measurements, combined with accurate estimation of stellar parameters, we validated the planetary nature of TOI-1807 b and measured its orbital and physical parameters.Results. By using astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic observations, we found that BD+39 2643 is a young, active K dwarf star and a member of a 300 \u00b1 80 Myr old moving group. Furthermore, it rotates in Prot = 8.8 \u00b1 0.1 days. This star hosts an ultra-short period planet, exhibiting an orbital period of only Pb = 0.54937 \u00b1 0.00001 days. Thanks to the exquisite photometric and spectroscopic series, along with the accurate information on its stellar activity, we measured both the radius and the mass of TOI-1807 b with high precision, obtaining PP,b = 1.37 \u00b1 0.09 R\u2295 and MP,b = 2.57 \u00b1 0.50 M\u2295. These planet parameters correspond to a rocky planet with an Earth-like density (\u03c1b = 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u03c1\u2295) and no extended H/He envelope. From the analysis of the age-RP distribution for planets with well measured ages, we inferred that TOI-1807 b may have already lost a large part of its atmosphere over the course of its 300 Myr lifetime.",
"Context.Complex organic molecules are detected in many sources in the warm inner regions of envelopes surrounding deeply embedded protostars. Exactly how these species form remains an open question.Aims.This study aims to constrain the formation of complex organic molecules through comparisons of their abundances towards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293\u20132422.Methods.We utilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293\u20132422. The species identification and the rotational temperature and column density estimation were derived by fitting the extracted spectra towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 A and IRAS 16293\u20132422 B with synthetic spectra. The majority of the work in this paper pertains to the analysis of IRAS 16293\u20132422 A for a comparison with the results from the other binary component, which have already been published.Results.We detect 15 different complex species, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous companion protostar IRAS 16293\u20132422 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11 isotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first detections of methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH) and trans-ethyl methyl ether (t-C2H5OCH3) towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 B and the follow-up detection of deuterated isotopologues of acetaldehyde (CH2DCHO and CH3CDO). Twenty-four lines of doubly-deuterated methanol (CHD2OH) are also identified.Conclusions.The comparison between the two protostars of the binary system shows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are partially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is consistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher expected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the hot corino towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in IRAS 16293\u20132422 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In parallel, the list of identified CHD2OH lines shows the need of accurate spectroscopic data including their line strength.",
" A multitude of phenomena\u2014such as the chemical enrichment of the Universe, the mass spectrum of planetary nebulae, white dwarfs and gravitational wave progenitors, the frequency distribution of supernovae, the fate of exoplanets, etc.\u2014are highly regulated by the amounts of mass that stars expel through a powerful wind. For more than half a century, these winds of cool aging stars have been interpreted within the common interpretive framework of 1D models. I here discuss how that framework now appears to be highly problematic. \u25aa\u2002 Current 1D mass-loss rate formulae differ by orders of magnitude, rendering contemporary stellar evolution predictions highly uncertain.  These stellar winds harbor 3D complexities that bridge 23 orders of magnitude in scale, ranging from the nanometer up to thousands of astronomical units. We need to embrace and understand these 3D spatial realities if we aim to quantify mass loss and assess its effect on stellar evolution. We therefore need to gauge the following: \u25aa\u2002 The 3D life of molecules and solid-state aggregates: The gas-phase clusters that form the first dust seeds are not yet identified. This limits our ability to predict mass-loss rates using a self-consistent approach. \u25aa\u2002 The emergence of 3D clumps: They contribute in a nonnegligible way to the mass loss, although they seem of limited importance for the wind-driving mechanism. \u25aa\u2002 The 3D lasting impact of a (hidden) companion: Unrecognized binary interaction has biased previous mass-loss rate estimates toward values that are too large.  Only then will it be possible to drastically improve our predictive power of the evolutionary path in 4D (classical) spacetime of any star. ",
"Gravity modes (g modes), mixed gravito-acoustic modes (mixed modes), and gravito-inertial modes (gi modes) possess unmatched properties as probes for stars with radiative interiors. The structural and dynamical constraints that they are able to provide cannot be accessed by other means. While they provide precious insights into the internal dynamics of evolved stars as well as massive and intermediate-mass stars, their non-detection in main sequence (MS) solar-type stars make them a crucial missing piece in our understanding of angular momentum transport in radiative zones and stellar rotational evolution. In this work, we aim to apply certain analysis tools originally developed for helioseismology in order to look for g-mode signatures in MS solar-type stars. We select a sample of the 34 most promising MS solar-type stars with Kepler four-year long photometric time series. All these stars are well-characterised late F-type stars with thin convective envelopes, fast convective flows, and stochastically excited acoustic modes (p modes). For each star, we compute the background noise level of the Fourier power spectrum to identify significant peaks at low frequency. After successfully detecting individual peaks in 12 targets, we further analyse four of them and observe distinct patterns of surrounding peaks with a low probability of being noise artifacts. Comparisons with the predictions from reference models suggest that these patterns are compatible with the presence of non-asymptotic low-order pure g modes, pure p modes, and mixed modes. Given their sensitivity to both the convective core interface stratification and the coupling between p- and g-mode resonant cavities, such modes are able to provide strong constraints on the structure and evolutionary states of the related targets. Considering the granulation and activity background of the stars in our sample, we subsequently compute the corresponding mode velocity necessary to trigger a detectable luminosity fluctuation. We use it to estimate the surface velocity, \u27e8vr\u27e9, of the candidate modes we have detected. In this case, we find \u27e8vr\u27e9\u223c10 cm s\u22121. These results could be extremely useful for characterising the deep interior of MS solar-type stars, as the upcoming PLATO mission will considerably expand the size of the available working sample.",
" The bulk of cosmic matter resides in a dilute reservoir that fills the space between galaxies, the intergalactic medium (IGM). The history of this reservoir is intimately tied to the cosmic histories of structure formation, star formation, and supermassive black hole accretion. Our models for the IGM at intermediate redshifts (2\u2272z\u22725) are a tremendous success, quantitatively explaining the statistics of Ly\u03b1 absorption of intergalactic hydrogen. However, at both lower and higher redshifts (and around galaxies) much is still unknown about the IGM. We review the theoretical models and measurements that form the basis for the modern understanding of the IGM, and we discuss unsolved puzzles (ranging from the largely unconstrained process of reionization at high z to the missing baryon problem at low z), highlighting the efforts that have the potential to solve them.

" Star and planet formation are the complex outcomes of gravitational collapse and angular momentum transport mediated by protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In this review, we focus on the role of gravitational instability in this process. We begin with a brief overview of the observational evidence for massive disks that might be subject to gravitational instability and then highlight the diverse ways in which the instability manifests itself in protostellar and protoplanetary disks: the generation of spiral arms, small-scale turbulence-like density fluctuations, and fragmentation of the disk itself. We present the analytic theory that describes the linear growth phase of the instability supplemented with a survey of numerical simulations that aim to capture the nonlinear evolution. We emphasize the role of thermodynamics and large-scale infall in controlling the outcome of the instability. Despite apparent controversies in the literature, we show a remarkable level of agreement between analytic predictions and numerical results. In the next part of our review, we focus on the astrophysical consequences of the instability. We show that the disks most likely to be gravitationally unstable are young and relatively massive compared with their host star, Md/M*\u22650.1. They will develop quasi-stable spiral arms that process infall from the background cloud. Although instability is less likely at later times, once infall becomes less important, the manifestations of the instability are more varied. In this regime, the disk thermodynamics, often regulated by stellar irradiation, dictates the development and evolution of the instability. In some cases the instability may lead to fragmentation into bound companions. These companions are more likely to be brown dwarfs or stars than planetary mass objects. Finally, we highlight open questions related to the development of a turbulent cascade in thin disks and the role of mode-mode coupling in setting the maximum angular momentum transport rate in thick disks.

"During solar flares a tremendous amount of magnetic energy is released and transported through the Sun\u2019s atmosphere and out into the heliosphere. Despite over a century of study, many unresolved questions surrounding solar flares are still present. Among those are how does the solar plasma respond to flare energy deposition, and what are the important physical processes that transport that energy from the release site in the corona through the transition region and chromosphere? Attacking these questions requires the concert of advanced numerical simulations and high spatial-, temporal-, and spectral-resolution observations. While flares are 3D phenomenon, simulating the NLTE flaring chromosphere in 3D and performing parameter studies of 3D models is largely outwith our current computational capabilities. We instead rely on state-of-the-art 1D field-aligned simulations to study the physical processes that govern flares. Over the last decade, data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) have provided the crucial observations with which we can critically interrogate the predictions of those flare loop models. Here in Paper 2 of a two-part review of IRIS and flare loop models, I discuss how forward modelling flares can help us understand the observations from IRIS, and how IRIS can reveal where our models do well and where we are likely missing important processes, focussing in particular on the plasma properties, energy transport mechanisms, and future directions of flare modelling.",
"Rotation matters for the life of a star. It causes a multitude of dynamical phenomena in the stellar interior during a star\u2019s evolution, and its effects accumulate until the star dies. All stars rotate at some level, but most of those born with a mass higher than 1.3 times the mass of the Sun rotate rapidly during more than 90% of their nuclear lifetime. Internal rotation guides the angular momentum and chemical element transport throughout the stellar interior. These transport processes change over time as the star evolves. The cumulative effects of stellar rotation and its induced transport processes determine the helium content of the core by the time it exhausts its hydrogen isotopes. The amount of helium at that stage also guides the heavy element yields by the end of the star\u2019s life. A proper theory of stellar evolution and any realistic models for the chemical enrichment of galaxies must be based on observational calibrations of stellar rotation and of the induced transport processes. In the last few years, asteroseismology offers such calibrations for single and binary stars. We review the current status of asteroseismic modelling of rotating stars for different stellar mass regimes in an accessible way for the non-expert. While doing so, we describe exciting opportunities sparked by asteroseismology for various domains in astrophysics, touching upon topics such as exoplanetary science, galactic structure and evolution, and gravitational wave physics to mention just a few. Along the way we provide ample sneak-previews for future \u2018industrialised\u2019 applications of asteroseismology to slow and rapid rotators from the exploitation of combined Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO), Gaia, and ground-based spectroscopic and multi-colour photometric surveys. We end the review with a list of takeaway messages and achievements of asteroseismology that are of relevance for many fields of astrophysics.",
" Since the detection a decade ago of the planetary companion of 51 Peg, more than 200 extrasolar planets have been unveiled, mostly by radial-velocity measurements but also in a few cases by photometric transit observations or in microlensing experiments. They present a wide variety of characteristics such as large masses with small orbital separations, high eccentricities, period resonances in multiplanet systems, etc. Meaningful features of the statistical distributions of orbital parameters for giant planets or of parent stellar properties have emerged. We discuss them in the context of the constraints they provide for planet-formation models, and in comparison to Neptune-mass planets in short-period orbits recently detected by radial-velocity surveys. Finally, the role of radial-velocity follow-up measurements of transit candidates is emphasized. Planetary physical parameters are determined, bringing important constraints for inner planet structure models. ",
"Galaxy morphology is a powerful diagnostic to assess the realism of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Determining the morphology of simulated galaxies requires the generation of synthetic images through 3D radiative transfer post-processing that properly accounts for different stellar populations and interstellar dust attenuation. We use the SKIRT code to generate the TNG50-SKIRT Atlas, a synthetic UV to near-infrared broadband image atlas for a complete stellar-mass selected sample of 1154 galaxies extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation at z = 0. The images have a high spatial resolution (100 pc) and a wide field of view (160 kpc). In addition to the dust-obscured images, we also release dust-free images and physical parameter property maps with matching characteristics. As a sanity check and preview application we discuss the UVJ diagram of the galaxy sample. We investigate the effect of dust attenuation on the UVJ diagram and find that it affects both the star-forming and the quiescent galaxy populations. The quiescent galaxy region is polluted by younger and star-forming highly inclined galaxies, while dust attenuation induces a separation in inclination of the star-forming galaxy population, with low-inclination galaxies remaining at the blue side of the diagram and high-inclination galaxies systematically moving towards the red side. This image atlas can be used for a variety of other applications, including galaxy morphology studies and the investigation of local scaling relations. We publicly release the images and parameter maps, and we invite the community to use them.",
"Star-forming regions show a rich and varied chemistry, including the presence of complex organic molecules\u2014in both the cold gas distributed on large scales and the hot regions close to young stars where protoplanetary disks arise. Recent advances in observational techniques have opened new possibilities for studying this chemistry. In particular, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array has made it possible to study astrochemistry down to Solar System\u2013size scales while also revealing molecules of increasing variety and complexity. In this review, we discuss recent observations of the chemistry of star-forming environments, with a particular focus on complex organic molecules, taking context from the laboratory experiments and chemical models that they have stimulated. The key takeaway points include the following: \u25aa\u2002 The physical evolution of individual sources plays a crucial role in their inferred chemical signatures and remains an important area for observations and models to elucidate. \u25aa\u2002 Comparisons of the abundances measured toward different star-forming environments (high-mass versus low-mass, Galactic Center versus Galactic disk) reveal a remarkable similarity, which is an indication that the underlying chemistry is relatively independent of variations in their physical conditions. \u25aa\u2002 Studies of molecular isotopologues in star-forming regions provide a link with measurements in our own Solar System, and thus may shed light on the chemical similarities and differences expected in other planetary systems.",
"Context.Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to be intimately connected with their host galaxies through feeding and feedback processes. A strong coupling is predicted and supported by cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, but the details of the physical mechanisms are still observationally unconstrained.Aims.Galaxies are complex systems of stars and a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). A spatially resolved multiwavelength survey is required to map the interaction of AGN with their host galaxies on different spatial scales and different phases of the ISM. The goal of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) is to obtain the necessary spatially resolved multiwavelength observations for an unbiased sample of local unobscured luminous AGN.Methods.We present the overall CARS survey design and the associated wide-field optical integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy for all 41 CARS targets atz\u2004<\u20040.06 randomly selected from the Hamburg/ESO survey of luminous unobscured AGN. This data set provides the backbone of the CARS survey and allows us to characterize host galaxy morphologies, AGN parameters, precise systemic redshifts, and ionized gas distributions including excitation conditions, kinematics, and metallicities in unprecedented detail.Results.We focus our study on the size of the extended narrow-line region (ENLR) which has been traditionally connected to AGN luminosity. Given the large scatter in the ENLR size\u2013luminosity relation, we performed a large parameter search to identify potentially more fundamental relations. Remarkably, we identified the strongest correlation between the maximum projected ENLR size and the black hole mass, consistent with anRENLR,max\u223cMBH0.5relationship. We interpret the maximum ENLR size as a timescale indicator of a single black hole (BH) radiative-efficient accretion episode for which we inferred \u2329log(tAGN/[yr])\u232a\u2005=\u2005(0.45\u2005\u00b1\u20050.08)log(MBH/[M\u2299])\u2005+\u20051.78\u22120.67+0.54using forward modeling. The extrapolation of our inferred relation toward higher BH masses is consistent with an independent lifetime estimate from the He\u202fIIproximity zones around luminous AGN atz\u2004\u223c\u20043.Conclusions.While our proposed link between the BH mass and AGN lifetime might be a secondary correlation itself or impacted by unknown biases, it has a few relevant implications if confirmed. For example, the famous AGN Eigenvector 1 parameter space may be partially explained by the range in AGN lifetimes. Also, the lack of observational evidence for negative AGN feedback on star formation can be explained by such timescale effects. Further observational tests are required to confirm or rule out our BH mass dependent AGN lifetime hypothesis.",
" Accretion through circumstellar disks plays an important role in star formation and in establishing the properties of the regions in which planets form and migrate. The mechanisms by which protostellar and protoplanetary disks accrete onto low-mass stars are not clear; angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is thought to be involved, but the low-ionization conditions in major regions of protoplanetary disks lead to a variety of complex nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects whose implications are not fully understood. Accretion in pre-main-sequence stars of masses \u22721M\u2299 (and in at least some 2\u20133-M\u2299 systems) is generally funneled by the stellar magnetic field, which disrupts the disk at scales typically of order a few stellar radii. Matter moving at near free-fall velocities shocks at the stellar surface; the resulting accretion luminosities from the dissipation of kinetic energy indicate that mass addition during the T Tauri phase over the typical disk lifetime \u223c3 Myr is modest in terms of stellar evolution, but is comparable to total disk reservoirs as estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission (\u223c10\u22122 M\u2299). Pre-main-sequence accretion is not steady, encompassing timescales ranging from approximately hours to a century, with longer-timescale variations tending to be the largest. Accretion during the protostellar phase\u2014while the protostellar envelope is still falling onto the disk\u2014is much less well understood, mostly because the properties of the central obscured protostar are difficult to estimate. Kinematic measurements of protostellar masses with new interfometric facilities should improve estimates of accretion rates during the earliest phases of star formation. ",
"Context. Transport processes occurring in the radiative interior of solar-type stars are evidenced by the surface variation of light elements, in particular 7Li, and the evolution of their rotation rates. For the Sun, inversions of helioseismic data indicate that the radial profile of angular velocity in its radiative zone is nearly uniform, which implies the existence of angular momentum transport mechanisms that are efficient over evolutionary timescales. While there are many independent transport models for angular momentum and chemical species, there is a lack of self-consistent theories that permit stellar evolution models to simultaneously match the present-day observations of solar lithium abundances and radial rotation profiles.Aims. We explore how additional transport processes can improve the agreement between evolutionary models of rotating stars and observations for 7Li depletion, the rotation evolution of solar-type stars, and the solar rotation profile.Methods. Models of solar-type stars are computed including atomic diffusion and rotation-induced mixing with the code STAREVOL. We explore different additional transport processes for chemicals and for angular momentum such as penetrative convection, tachocline mixing, and additional turbulence. We constrain the resulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation rate and 7Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters with different ages, and the solar surface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology when our models reach the age of the Sun.Results. We show the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of 7Li in pre-main sequence and early main sequence stars. The rotational dependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation between the initial rotation rate and 7Li depletion in our models of solar-type stars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity \u03bdadd leads to efficient transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope during the main sequence evolution and to solar-type models that match the observed profile of the Sun. We also self-consistently compute for the first time the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is compatible with helioseismic estimations at the age of the Sun, but we highlight that the associated turbulence does not allow the observed 7Li depletion to be reproduced. The main sequence depletion of 7Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric turbulent mixing below the convective envelope.Conclusions. The need for additional transport processes in stellar evolution models for both chemicals and angular momentum in addition to atomic diffusion, meridional circulation, and turbulent shear is confirmed. We identify the rotational dependence of the penetrative convection as a key process. Two additional and distinct parametric turbulent mixing processes (one for angular momentum and one for chemicals) are required to simultaneously explain the observed surface 7Li depletion and the solar internal rotation profile. We highlight the need of additional constraints for the internal rotation of young solar-type stars and also for the beryllium abundances of open clusters in order to test our predictions.",
"Aims. We provide the most accurate estimate yet of the bright end of the infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) and the abundance of hyperluminous IR galaxies (HLIRGs) with IR luminosities >1013L\u2299, thanks to the combination of the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and large area of the LOFAR Deep Fields, which probes an unprecedented dynamic range of luminosity and volume.Methods. We cross-match Herschel sources and LOFAR sources in Bo\u00f6tes (8.63 deg2), Lockman Hole (10.28 deg2), and ELAIS-N1 (6.74 deg2) with rms sensitivities of ~32, 22, and 20 \u03bcJy beam\u22121, respectively. We divide the matched samples into \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cmultiple\u201d categories. For the multiple matches, we de-blend the Herschel fluxes using the LOFAR positions and the 150-MHz flux densities as priors. We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, combined with multi-wavelength counterpart identifications and photometric redshift estimates, to derive IR luminosities.Results. The depth of the LOFAR data allows us to identify highly complete (~92% completeness) samples of bright Herschel sources with a simple selection based on the 250 \u03bcm flux density (45, 40, and 35 mJy in Bo\u00f6tes, Lockman Hole, and ELAIS-N1, respectively). Most of the bright Herschel sources fall into the unique category (i.e. a single LOFAR counterpart). For the multiple matches, there is excellent correspondence between the radio emission and the far-IR emission. We find a good agreement in the IR LFs with a previous study out to z ~ 6 which used de-blended Herschel data. Our sample gives the strongest and cleanest indication to date that the population of HLIRGs has surface densities of ~5 to ~18/deg2 (with variations due to a combination of the applied flux limit and cosmic variance) and an uncertainty of a factor of \u22722. In comparison, the GALFORM semi-analytic model significantly under-predicts the abundance of HLIRGs.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.

"Context.We study the spatially resolved properties of 343 elliptical galaxies with the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey.Aims.Our goal is to understand the fundamental processes of formation and quenching of elliptical galaxies.Methods.We used the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys for accurate morphological classification. Based on integrated spectroscopic properties and colors, we classified seven classes of elliptical galaxies. We inferred the stellar age and metallicity gradients out to a 1.5 effective radius (Reff) of classical \u201cred and dead\u201d, recently quenched, and blue star-forming ellipticals (CLEs, RQEs, and BSFs), corresponding to 73%, 10%, and 4% of the sample, respectively. Additionally, we reconstructed their global and radial histories of star formation and mass growth.Results.The mass- and luminosity-weighted age gradients of CLEs are nearly flat or mildly negative, with small differences between both ages. The respective metallicity gradients are negative (\u2207log[Zmw] = \u22120.11\u22120.08+0.07dex/Reffand \u2207log[Zlw] = \u22120.11\u22120.07+0.06dex/Reff, respectively), being flatter as the mass is smaller. The more massive CLEs formed stars earlier and quenched faster than the less massive ones. The CLEs show a weak inside-out growth and a clear inside-out quenching. They finished their quenching globally 3.8\u2006\u2005\u00b1\u2005\u20061.2 Gyr ago on average, with quenching time-scales of 3.4\u2006\u2005\u00b1\u2005\u20060.8 Gyr. AtM\u22c6< 1011\u2006M\u2299, the age andZgradients of the RQEs and BSFs are flatter than those of the CLEs, but with larger scatters. They show very weak inside-out growth and quenching, which is slow and not even completed atz\u2004\u223c\u20040 for the BSFs. Instead, the massive RQEs show an outside-in quenching and positive gradients in the luminosity-weighted age and stellar metallicities. The RQEs of all masses quenched 1.2 \u00b1 0.9 Gyr ago on average.Conclusions.Our results for the CLEs are consistent with a two-phase scenario where their inner parts formed by an early and coeval dissipative collapse with a consequent burst of star formation and further quenching, whereas the outer parts continued their assembly, likely by dry mergers. We also discuss some evolutionary scenarios for the RQE and BSF galaxies that would agree with the generic results.",
"Astronomers have played many roles in their engagement with the larger astronomy education ecosystem. Their activities have served both the formal and informal education communities worldwide, with levels of involvement from the occasional participant to the full-time professional.

" In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy\u2013halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy\u2013halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy\u2013halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 1012M\u2299, less than 20% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.

"The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a significant astronomical component, perpetuated through oral tradition, ceremony, and art. This astronomical knowledge includes a deep understanding of the motion of objects in the sky, which was used for practical purposes such as constructing calendars and for navigation. There is also evidence that traditional Aboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical phenomena, recorded unexpected phenomena such as eclipses and meteorite impacts, and could determine the cardinal points to an accuracy of a few degrees. Putative explanations of celestial phenomena appear throughout the oral record, suggesting traditional Aboriginal Australians sought to understand the natural world around them, in the same way as modern scientists, but within their own cultural context. There is also a growing body of evidence for sophisticated navigational skills, including the use of astronomically based songlines. Songlines are effectively oral maps of the landscape, and are an efficient way of transmitting oral navigational skills in cultures that do not have a written language. The study of Aboriginal astronomy has had an impact extending beyond mere academic curiosity, facilitating cross-cultural understanding, demonstrating the intimate links between science and culture, and helping students to engage with science.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The common envelope phase of binary star evolution plays an essential role in the formation of short period systems containing a compact object. In this process, significant mass and angular momentum are lost, transforming a wide progenitor system into a close remnant binary. The pathways leading to this phase and the outcomes are described. Emphasis is placed on the conditions that are required for survival of the binary according to the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculations. The evolution of high-mass systems containing neutron stars is discussed, including double neutron stars, binary pulsars, Thorne-Zytkow objects, and high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.",

"By appealing to a quark nova (QN; the explosive transition of a neutron star to a quark star) in the wake of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion of a massive star, we develop a unified model for long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and fast radio bursts (FRBs). The time delay (years to decades) between the SN and the QN, and the fragmented nature (i.e., millions of chunks) of the relativistic QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine. In our model, an LGRB light curve exhibits the interaction of the fragmented QN ejecta with turbulent (i.e., filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta which is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The afterglow is due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN ejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model can fit BAT/XRT prompt and afterglow light curves simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding the observed properties of LGRBs (e.g., the Band function and the X-ray flares). We find that the peak luminositypeak photon energy relationship (i.e., the Yonetoku law), and the isotropic energy-peak photon energy relationship (i.e., the Amati law) are not fundamental but phenomenological. FRB-like emission in our model results from coherent synchrotron emission (CSE) when the QN chunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where conditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification induced by the Weibel instability in the shocked chunk frame sets the bunching length for electrons and pairs to radiate coherently. The resulting emission frequency, luminosity and duration in our model are consistent with FRB data. We find a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs (i.e., those connected to CCSNe) to LGRBs including X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich GRBs (XRR-GRBs) as well as superluminous SNe (SLSNe). We find a possible connection between ultra-high energy cosmic rays and FRBs and propose that a QN following a binary neutron star merger can yield a short duration GRB (SGRB) with fits to BAT/XRT light curves.",
" The modest science of cosmology I encountered a half century ago has grown into big science. I comment on steps in this development I think I understand because I was there or, in some cases, wish I had been. Wonderful insights\u2014or lucky guesses\u2014and elegant deductions from measurements were accompanied by the usual mix of unlucky guesses and disregard of unwelcome evidence. I say \u201cusual\u201d because I suspect the course of development of any other natural science is similarly erratic. An example in cosmology is Einstein's homogeneous Universe, which was largely accepted as a working hypothesis when there was scant evidence and seriously challenged after we had a reasonable case for homogeneity. Similar mixes of insight and inattention led to the eventual identification of the 3K microwave background, the demonstration that large-scale structure grew by the gravitational instability of the expanding Universe, and the completion of a tight network of cosmological tests. A half century ago, we had little idea what would become of what we were doing in cosmology. We have a better picture now, but I expect there to be more surprises. ",
"We report the discovery and characterisation of a super-Earth and a sub-Neptune transiting the bright (K = 8.8), quiet, and nearby (37 pc) M3V dwarf TOI-1266. We validate the planetary nature of TOI-1266 b and c using four sectors of TESS photometry and data from the newly-commissioned 1-m SAINT-EX telescope located in San Pedro M\u00e1rtir (M\u00e9xico). We also include additional ground-based follow-up photometry as well as high-resolution spectroscopy and high-angular imaging observations. The inner, larger planet has a radius of R\u2009=\u20092.37\u22120.12+0.16 R\u2295 and an orbital period of 10.9 days. The outer, smaller planet has a radius of R\u2009=\u20091.56\u22120.13+0.15 R\u2295 on an 18.8-day orbit. The data are found to be consistent with circular, co-planar and stable orbits that are weakly influenced by the 2:1 mean motion resonance. Our TTV analysis of the combined dataset enables model-independent constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We find planetary masses of Mp = 13.5\u22129.0+11.0 M\u2295 (<36.8 M\u2295 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 b and 2.2\u22121.5+2.0 M\u2295 (<5.7 M\u2295 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 c. We find small but non-zero orbital eccentricities of 0.09\u22120.05+0.06 (<0.21 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 b and 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 (< 0.10 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 c. The equilibrium temperatures of both planets are of 413 \u00b1 20 and 344 \u00b1 16 K, respectively, assuming a null Bond albedo and uniform heat redistribution from the day-side to the night-side hemisphere. The host brightness and negligible activity combined with the planetary system architecture and favourable planet-to-star radii ratios makes TOI-1266 an exquisite system for a detailed characterisation.",

"The nuclei of most normal galaxies contain supermassive black holes, which can accrete gas through a disk and become active. These active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can form jets that are observed on scales from astronomical units to megaparsecs and from meter wavelengths to TeV energies. High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: \u25aa Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. \u25aa AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. \u25aa Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. \u25aa Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron \u03b3-rays. \u25aa Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. \u25aa Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.

" Cosmic-ray astrophysics has advanced rapidly in recent years, and its impact on other astronomical disciplines has broadened. Many new experiments measuring these particles, both directly in the atmosphere or space and indirectly via \u03b3 rays and synchrotron radiation, have widened the range and quality of the information available on their origin, propagation, and interactions. The impact of low-energy cosmic rays on interstellar chemistry is a fast-developing topic, including the propagation of these particles into the clouds in which the chemistry occurs. Cosmic rays, via their \u03b3-ray production, also provide a powerful way to probe the gas content of the interstellar medium. Substantial advances have been made in the observations and modelling of the interplay between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. Focusing on energies up to 1 TeV, these interrelating aspects are covered at various levels of detail, giving a guide to the state of the subject. ",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 At luminosities above 1011 [Formula: see text], infrared galaxies become the dominant population of extragalactic objects in the local Universe (z \u2272 0.3), being more numerous than optically selected starburst and Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable bolometric luminosity. The trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction/merger of molecular gas-rich spirals, and the bulk of the infrared luminosity for all but the most luminous objects is due to dust heating from an intense starburst within giant molecular clouds. At the highest luminosities (Lir > 1012 [Formula: see text]), nearly all objects appear to be advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst and active galactic nucleus energy sources, both of which are fueled by an enormous concentration of molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus. These ultraluminous infrared galaxies may represent an important stage in the formation of quasi-stellar objects and powerful radio galaxies. They may also represent a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxy cores, the formation of globular clusters, and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. ",
"There is a broad consensus that accretion onto supermassive black holes and consequent jet formation power the observed emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there has been less agreement about how jets form in accretion flows, their possible relationship to black hole spin, and how they interact with the surrounding medium. There have also been theoretical concerns about instabilities in standard accretion disk models and lingering discrepancies with observational constraints. Despite seemingly successful applications to X-ray binaries, the standard accretion disk model faces a growing list of observational constraints that challenge its application to AGNs. Theoretical exploration of these questions has become increasingly reliant on numerical simulations owing to the dynamic nature of these flows and the complex interplay between hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, radiation transfer, and curved spacetime. We conclude the following: \u25aa\u2002 The advent of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations has greatly improved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole spin. \u25aa\u2002 Simulation results show both disks and jets are sensitive to the magnetic flux threading the accretion flow as well as possible misalignment between the angular momentum of the accretion flow and the black hole spin. \u25aa\u2002 Radiation MHD simulations are providing new insights into the stability of luminous accretion flows and highlighting the potential importance of radiation viscosity, UV opacity from atoms, and spiral density waves in AGNs.",

"Chemical equilibrium has proven extremely useful for predicting the chemical composition of AGB atmospheres. Here we use a recently developed code and an updated thermochemical database that includes gaseous and condensed species involving 34 elements to compute the chemical equilibrium composition of AGB atmospheres of M-, S-, and C-type stars. We include for the first time TixCyclusters, withx= 1\u20134 andy= 1\u20134, and selected larger clusters ranging up to Ti13C22, for which thermochemical data are obtained from quantum-chemical calculations. Our main aims are to systematically survey the main reservoirs of each element in AGB atmospheres, review the successes and failures of chemical equilibrium by comparing it with the latest observational data, identify potentially detectable molecules that have not yet been observed, and diagnose the most likely gas-phase precursors of dust and determine which clusters might act as building blocks of dust grains. We find that in general, chemical equilibrium reproduces the observed abundances of parent molecules in circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars well. There are, however, severe discrepancies of several orders of magnitude for some parent molecules that are observed to be anomalously overabundant with respect to the predictions of chemical equilibrium. These are HCN, CS, NH3, and SO2in M-type stars, H2O and NH3in S-type stars, and the hydrides H2O, NH3, SiH4, and PH3in C-type stars. Several molecules have not yet been observed in AGB atmospheres but are predicted with non-negligible abundances and are good candidates for detection with observatories such as ALMA. The most interesting ones are SiC5, SiNH, SiCl, PS, HBO, and the metal-containing molecules MgS, CaS, CaOH, CaCl, CaF, ScO, ZrO, VO, FeS, CoH, and NiS. In agreement with previous studies, the first condensates predicted to appear in C-rich atmospheres are found to be carbon, TiC, and SiC, while Al2O3is the first major condensate expected in O-rich outflows. According to our chemical equilibrium calculations, the gas-phase precursors of carbon dust are probably acetylene, atomic carbon, and/or C3, while for silicon carbide dust, the most likely precursors are the molecules SiC2and Si2C. In the case of titanium carbide dust, atomic Ti is the major reservoir of this element in the inner regions of AGB atmospheres, and therefore it is probably the main supplier of titanium during the formation of TiC dust. However, chemical equilibrium predicts that large titanium-carbon clusters such as Ti8C12and Ti13C22become the major reservoirs of titanium at the expense of atomic Ti in the region where condensation of TiC is expected to occur. This suggests that the assembly of large TixCyclusters might be related to the formation of the first condensation nuclei of TiC. In the case of Al2O3dust, chemical equilibrium indicates that atomic Al and the carriers of Al-O bonds AlOH, AlO, and Al2O are the most likely gas-phase precursors.",
"We study historic observations of solar activity from the 20th-century rise towards the peak of the Modern Grand Solar Maximum (MGSM) and compare with observations of the decline that has occurred since. The major difference in available solar observations of the rise and of the fall are accurate magnetograms from solar magnetographs: we here use synthetic magnetograms to interpret the rise and employ historic observations of Polar Crown Filaments to test them and verify their use. We show that eclipse images at sunspot minimum reveal the long-term variation of open flux deduced from geomagnetic observations in Paper 1 (Lockwood et al., 2022). We also make use of polar coronal hole fluxes derived from historic white light images of polar faculae, but have to consider the implications of the fact that these facular images do not tell us the polarity of the field. Given this caveat, the agreement between the polar coronal hole fluxes and the values derived from open flux continuity modelling based on sunspot numbers is extremely good. This comparison indicates that one possible solution to the \u201copen flux problem\u201d is open flux within the streamer belt that potential-based modelling of coronal fields from photospheric fields is not capturing. We take a detailed look at the solar cycle at the peak of the MGSM, cycle 19, and show the variation of the polar coronal hole fluxes and the inferred poleward flux surges are predictable from the asymmetries in flux emergence in the two hemispheres with implied transequatorial flux transfer and/or \u201canti-Hale\u201d (or more general \u201crogue\u201d active region flux) emergence late in the sunspot cycle.",
"We present the discovery of a transiting mini-Neptune around TOI-1201, a relatively bright and moderately young early M dwarf (J \u2248 9.5 mag, ~600\u2013800 Myr) in an equal-mass ~8 arcsecond-wide binary system, using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, along with follow-up transit observations. With an orbital period of 2.49 d, TOI-1201 b is a warm mini-Neptune with a radius of Rb = 2.415 \u00b1 0.090 R\u2295. This signal is also present in the precise radial velocity measurements from CARMENES, confirming the existence of the planet and providing a planetary mass of Mb = 6.28 \u00b1 0.88 M\u2295 and, thus, an estimated bulk density of 2.45\u22120.42+0.48 g cm\u22123. The spectroscopic observations additionally show evidence of a signal with a period of 19 d and a long periodic variation of undetermined origin. In combination with ground-based photometric monitoring from WASP-South and ASAS-SN, we attribute the 19 d signal to the stellar rotation period (Prot = 19\u201323 d), although we cannot rule out that the variation seen in photometry belongs to the visually close binary companion. We calculate precise stellar parameters for both TOI-1201 and its companion. The transiting planet is anexcellent target for atmosphere characterization (the transmission spectroscopy metric is 97\u221216+21) with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. It is also feasible to measure its spin-orbit alignment via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect using current state-of-the-art spectrographs with submeter per second radial velocity precision.",
"Context.The chemical inventory of planets is determined by the physical and chemical processes that govern the early phases of star formation. Nitrogen-bearing species are of interest as many provide crucial precursors in the formation of life-related matter.Aims.The aim is to investigate nitrogen-bearing complex organic molecules towards two deeply embedded Class 0 low-mass protostars (Perseus B1-c and Serpens S68N) at millimetre wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Next, the results of the detected nitrogen-bearing species are compared with those of oxygen-bearing species for the same and other sources. The similarities and differences are used as further input to investigate the underlying formation pathways.Methods.ALMA observations of B1-c and S68N in Band 6 (~1 mm) and Band 5 (~2 mm) are studied at ~0.5\u2032\u2032 resolution, complemented by Band 3 (~3 mm) data in a ~2.5\u2032\u2032 beam. The spectra are analysed for nitrogen-bearing species using the CASSIS spectral analysis tool, and the column densities and excitation temperatures are determined. A toy model is developed to investigate the effect of source structure on the molecular emission.Results.Formamide (NH2CHO), ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), isocyanic acid (HNCO, HN13CO, DNCO), and methyl cyanide (CH3CN, CH2DCN, and CHD2CN) are identified towards the investigated sources. Their abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources, with column densities that are typically an order of magnitude lower than those of oxygen-bearing species. The largest variations, of an order of magnitude, are seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do not correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties, the nitrogen-bearing species have similar excitation temperatures to those of oxygen-bearing species (~100\u2013300 K). The measured excitation temperatures are larger than the sublimation temperatures for the respective species.Conclusions.The similarity of most abundances with respect to HNCO for the investigated sources, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN, hints at a shared chemical history, especially the high D-to-H ratio in cold regions prior to star formation. However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the sensitivity of the chemistry to local conditions such as temperature (e.g. NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting areas of the molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The excitation temperatures likely reflect the mass-weighted kinetic temperature of a gas that follows a power law structure. The two sources discussed in this work add to the small number of sources that have been subjected to such a detailed chemical analysis on Solar System scales. Future data from theJames WebbSpace Telescope will allow a direct comparison between the ice and gas abundances of both smaller and larger nitrogen-bearing species.",
"Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\u25aaThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T \u223c 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\u25aaGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\u25aaIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\u25aaMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.",
"We analyzed more than 700 ultraviolet spectra of 45 nova-like stars (NLs) observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite, obtaining reliable data for 42 of them. Combining these with the distances from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and with results from the literature, for each object we determined the reddening EB\u2005\u2212\u2005V, the disk spectral energy distribution (SED), the reference (i.e., inclination-corrected) absolute magnitude and disk luminosity (MVref, Ldiskref), and the mass accretion rate (\u1e40), all with propagated errors. The de-reddened UV continuum of NLs in a high state is well approximated by a power-law distribution with index \u03b1 in the range \u22122.4\u2004\u2264\u2004\u03b1\u2004\u2264\u2004\u22120.2. The agreement between the power-law extrapolation to the V band and the observed V magnitude is outstanding and implies that for NLs in a high state, the disk continuum dominates not only in the UV but also in the optical, with other possible contributions (white dwarf, M dwarf, and hot spot) being minor. We note that the accretion rate correlates with the period, power-law index, and MVref, making them convenient proxies for \u1e40.

Nine of the 42 NLs fall within the period gap but all have \u1e40 very similar to that of the objects above the gap, contrary to theory expectations but in agreement with other observational work, and indicating that \u2212 at least for NLs \u2212 the theoretical assumptions of the standard model of the evolution of CVs need substantial revision. Medians and weighted means of log \u1e40 (\u2248 \u22128.5) are very similar among NL classes, and also to those of old novae, dispelling the prejudice that stars belonging to the SW Sex class of NLs have \u201cexceptionally high\u201d \u1e40 compared to other NLs (and old novae). In fact, it is one of the most interesting results of this study that NLs and old novae are indistinguishable in terms of \u1e40 and its correlation with MVref. Two NLs (V1315 Aql and BZ Cam) have shells around them, a likely fingerprint of a past nova eruption, but the suggested association with \u201cguest stars\u201d of ancient Chinese chronicles is questionable.",
"Context. The origin of water, particularly on Earth, is still a matter of heated debate. To date, the most widespread scenario is that the Earth originated without water and that it was brought to the planet mainly as a result of impacts by wet asteroids coming from further out in space. However, many uncertainties remain as to the exact processes that supplied an adequate amount of water to inner terrestrial planets.Aims. In this article, we explore a new mechanism that would allow water to be efficiently transported to planets without impacts. We propose that primordial asteroids were icy and that when the ice sublimated, it formed a gaseous disk that could then reach planets and deliver water.Methods. We have developed a new model that follows the sublimation of asteroids on gigayear (Gyr) timescales, taking into account the variable luminosity of the Sun. We then evolved the subsequent gas disk using a viscous diffusion code, which leads to the gas spreading both inwards and outwards in the Solar System. We can then quantify the amount of water that can be accreted onto each planet in a self-consistent manner using our code.Results. We find that this new disk-delivery mechanism is effective and equipped to explain the water content on Earth (with the correct D/H ratio) as well as on other planets and the Moon. Our model shows most of the water being delivered between 20 and 30 Myr after the birth of the Sun, when the Sun\u2019s luminosity increased sharply. Our scenario implies the presence of a gaseous water disk with substantial mass for hundreds of millions of years, which could be one of the key tracers of this mechanism. We show that such a watery disk could be detected in young exo-asteroid belts with ALMA.Conclusions. We propose that viscous water transport is inevitable and more generic than the impact scenario. We also suggest it is a universal process that may also occur in extrasolar systems. The conditions required for this scenario to unfold are indeed expected to be present in most planetary systems: an opaque proto-planetary disk that is initially cold enough for ice to form in the exo-asteroid belt region, followed by a natural outward-moving snow line that allows this initial ice to sublimate after the dissipation of the primordial disk, creating a viscous secondary gas disk and leading to the accretion of water onto the exo-planets.",
"Context. There is currently a niche for providing high-cadence, high resolution, time-series optical spectroscopy from space, which can be filled by using a low-cost cubesat mission. The Belgian-led ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec mission is specifically designed to provide space-based, low-cost spectroscopy with specific capabilities that can be optimised for a particular science need. Approved as an ESA in-orbit demonstrator, the CubeSpec satellite\u2019s primary science objective will be to focus on obtaining high-cadence, high resolution optical spectroscopic data to facilitate asteroseismology of pulsating massive stars.Aims. In this first paper, we aim to search for pulsating massive stars suitable for the CubeSpec mission, specifically \u03b2 Cep stars, which typically require time-series spectroscopy to identify the geometry of their pulsation modes.Methods. Based on the science requirements needed to enable asteroseismology of massive stars with the capabilities of CubeSpec\u2019s spectrograph, we combined a literature study for pulsation with the analysis of recent high-cadence time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission to classify the variability for stars brighter than V\u2004\u2264\u20044 mag and between O9 and B3 in spectral type.Results. Among the 90 stars that meet our magnitude and spectral type requirements, we identified 23 promising \u03b2 Cep stars with high-amplitude (non-)radial pulsation modes with frequencies below 7 d\u22121. Using further constraints on projected rotational velocities, pulsation amplitudes, and the number of pulsation modes, we devised a prioritised target list for the CubeSpec mission according to its science requirements and the potential of the targets for asteroseismology. The full target catalogue further provides a modern TESS-based review of line profile and photometric variability properties among bright O9\u2013B3 stars.",
"The Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) is a blind narrow-band (NB) H\u03b1+[NII] imaging survey carried out with MegaCam at the Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii Telescope. The survey covers the whole Virgo cluster region from its core to one virial radius (104 deg2). The sensitivity of the survey is of f(H\u03b1) ~ 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (5\u03c3 detection limit) for point sources and \u03a3(H\u03b1) ~ 2 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 (1\u03c3 detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making VESTIGE the deepest and largest blind NB survey of a nearby cluster. This paper presents the survey in all its technical aspects, including the survey design, the observing strategy, the achieved sensitivity in both the NB H\u03b1+[NII] and in the broad-band r filter used for the stellar continuum subtraction, the data reduction, calibration, and products, as well as its status after the first observing semester. We briefly describe the H\u03b1 properties of galaxies located in a 4 \u00d7 1 deg2 strip in the core of the cluster north of M87, where several extended tails of ionised gas are detected. This paper also lists the main scientific motivations for VESTIGE, which include the study of the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution, the fate of the stripped gas in cluster objects, the star formation process in nearby galaxies of different type and stellar mass, the determination of the H\u03b1 luminosity function and of the H\u03b1 scaling relations down to ~106 M\u2299 stellar mass objects, and the reconstruction of the dynamical structure of the Virgo cluster. This unique set of data will also be used to study the HII luminosity function in hundreds of galaxies, the diffuse H\u03b1+[NII] emission of the Milky Way at high Galactic latitude, and the properties of emission line galaxies at high redshift.",
"A decade ago cosmological simulations of \n               increasingly higher resolution were used to \n               demonstrate that virialized regions of Cold Dark \n               Matter (CDM) halos are filled with a multitude of \n               dense, gravitationally bound clumps.

"We propose a covariant formulation of refracted gravity (RG), which is a classical theory of gravity based on the introduction of gravitational permittivity \u2013 a monotonic function of the local mass density \u2013 in the standard Poisson equation. Gravitational permittivity mimics dark matter phenomenology. The covariant formulation of RG (CRG) that we propose belongs to the class of scalar-tensor theories, where the scalar field\u03c6has a self-interaction potential \ud835\udcb1(\u03c6) = \u2212\u2005\u039e\u03c6, with \u039e being a normalization constant. We show that the scalar field is twice the gravitational permittivity in the weak-field limit. Far from a spherical source of density\u03c1s(r), the transition between the Newtonian and the RG regime appears below the acceleration scalea\u039e\u2004=\u2004(2\u039e\u2005\u2212\u20058\u03c0G\u03c1/\u03c6)1/2, with\u03c1\u2004=\u2004\u03c1s\u2005+\u2005\u03c1bgand\u03c1bgbeing an isotropic and homogeneous background. In the limit 2\u039e\u2004\u226b\u20048\u03c0G\u03c1/\u03c6, we obtaina\u039e\u2004\u223c\u200410\u221210m s\u22122. This acceleration is comparable to the accelerationa0originally introduced in MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). From CRG, we also derived the modified Friedmann equations for an expanding, homogeneous, and isotropic universe. We find that the same scalar field\u03c6that mimics dark matter also drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe. From the stress-energy tensor of\u03c6, we derived the equation of state of a redshift-dependent effective dark energywDE\u2004=\u2004pDE/\u03c1DE. Current observational constraints onwDEand distance modulus data of type Ia supernovae suggest that \u039e has a comparable value to the cosmological constant \u039b in the standard model. Since \u039e also plays the same role of \u039b, CRG suggests a natural explanation of the known relationa0\u2004\u223c\u2004\u039b1/2. CRG thus appears to describe both the dynamics of cosmic structure and the expanding Universe with a single scalar field, and it falls within the family of models that unify the two dark sectors, highlighting a possible deep connection between phenomena currently attributed to dark matter and dark energy separately.",
"Dust-obscured star formation has dominated the cosmic history of star formation, since $$z \\simeq 4$$\n\nz\n\u2243\n4\n\n. However, the recent finding of significant amount of dust in galaxies out to $$z \\simeq 8$$\n\nz\n\u2243\n8\n\n has opened the new frontier of investigating the origin of dust also in the earliest phases of galaxy formation, within the first 1.5 billion years from the Big Bang. This is a key and rapid transition phase for the evolution of dust, as galaxy evolutionary timescales become comparable with the formation timescales of dust. It is also an area of research that is experiencing an impressive growth, especially thanks to the recent results from cutting edge observing facilities, ground-based, and in space. Our aim is to provide an overview of the several findings on dust formation and evolution at $$z > 4$$\n\nz\n>\n4\n\n, and of the theoretical efforts to explain the observational results. We have organized the review in two parts. In the first part, presented here, we focus on dust sources, primarily supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars, and the subsequent reprocessing of dust in the interstellar medium, through grain destruction and growth. We also discuss other dust production mechanisms, such as Red Super Giants, Wolf\u2013Rayet stars, Classical Novae, Type Ia Supernovae, and dust formation in quasar winds. The focus of this first part is on theoretical models of dust production sources, although we also discuss the comparison with observations in the nearby Universe, which are key to put constraints on individual sources and processes. While the description has a general applicability at any redshift, we emphasize the relative role of different sources in the dust build-up in the early Universe. In the second part, which will be published later on, we will focus on the recent observational results at $$z > 4$$\n\nz\n>\n4\n\n, discussing the theoretical models that have been proposed to interpret those results, as well as the profound implications for galaxy formation.",
" We provide a nonspecialist overview of the current state of understanding of the structure and origin of our Solar System's transneptunian region (often called the Kuiper Belt), highlighting perspectives on planetesimal formation, planet migration, and the contextual relationship with protoplanetary disks.

"We present a new clustering method, significance mode analysis (SigMA), for extracting co-spatial and co-moving stellar populations from large-scale surveys such as ESAGaia. The method studies the topological properties of the density field in the multidimensional phase space. We validatedSigMAon simulated clusters and find that it outperforms competing methods, especially in cases where many clusters are closely spaced. We applied the new method toGaiaDR3 data of the closest OB association to Earth, Scorpio-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), and find more than 13 000 co-moving young objects, about 19% of which have a substellar mass.SigMAfinds 37 co-moving clusters in Sco-Cen. These clusters are independently validated by their narrow Hertzsprung-Russell diagram sequences and, to a certain extent, by their association with massive stars too bright forGaia, and are hence unknown toSigMA. We compared our results with similar recent work and find that theSigMAalgorithm recovers richer populations, is able to distinguish clusters with velocity differences down to about 0.5 km s\u22121, and reaches cluster volume densities as low as 0.01 sources pc\u22123. The 3D distribution of these 37 coeval clusters implies a larger extent and volume for the Sco-Cen OB association than typically assumed in the literature. Additionally, we find the association more actively star-forming and dynamically complex than previously thought. We confirm that the star-forming molecular clouds in the Sco-Cen region, namely, Ophiuchus, L134/L183, Pipe Nebula, Corona Australis, Lupus, and Chamaeleon, are part of the Sco-Cen association. The application ofSigMAto Sco-Cen demonstrates that advanced machine learning tools applied to the superbGaiadata allows an accurate census of the young populations to be constructed, which in turn allows us to quantify their dynamics and recreate the recent star formation history of the local Milky Way.",
" We review observations of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). X-ray spectroscopic and timing studies of ULXs suggest a new accretion state distinct from those seen in Galactic stellar-mass black hole binaries. The detection of coherent pulsations indicates the presence of neutron-star accretors in three ULXs and therefore apparently super-Eddington luminosities. Optical and X-ray line profiles of ULXs and the properties of associated radio and optical nebulae suggest that ULXs produce powerful outflows, also indicative of super-Eddington accretion. We discuss models of super-Eddington accretion and their relationship to the observed behaviors of ULXs. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in ULXs. We consider the implications of ULXs for super-Eddington accretion in active galactic nuclei, heating of the early Universe, and the origin of the black hole binary recently detected via gravitational waves.

"Stars that formed with an initial mass of over 50 M\n\u2299 are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early Universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early follow-up of the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early Universe. J0931+0038 has a relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = \u22121.76 \u00b1 0.13) but an extreme odd\u2013even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass >50 M\n\u2299, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However, the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates the study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.",
"We describe the first observations of the same celestial object with gravitational waves and light. \u25aa\u2002 GW170817 was the first detection of a neutron star merger with gravitational waves. \u25aa\u2002 The detection of a spatially coincident weak burst of gamma-rays (GRB 170817A) 1.7 s after the merger constituted the first electromagnetic detection of a gravitational wave source and established a connection between at least some cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and binary neutron star mergers. \u25aa\u2002 A fast-evolving optical and near-infrared transient (AT 2017gfo) associated with the event can be interpreted as resulting from the ejection of \u223c0.05 M\u2299of material enriched in r-process elements, finally establishing binary neutron star mergers as at least one source of r-process nucleosynthesis. \u25aa\u2002 Radio and X-ray observations revealed a long-rising source that peaked \u223c160,d after the merger. Combined with the apparent superluminal motion of the associated very long baseline interferometry source, these observations show that the merger produced a relativistic structured jet whose core was oriented \u224820 deg from the line of sight and with properties similar to SGRBs. The jet structure likely results from interaction between the jet and the merger ejecta. \u25aa\u2002 The electromagnetic and gravitational wave information can be combined to produce constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. These multimessenger endeavors will be a major emphasis of future work.",
"Many late-type stars across the Milky Way exhibit observable pulsations similar to our Sun that open up a window into stellar interiors. The NASA Kepler mission, a space-based photometric telescope, measured the micro-magnitude luminosity fluctuations caused by solar-like oscillations of tens of thousands of stars for almost 10\u00a0years. Detailed stellar structure, evolution, and oscillation theoretical work established in the decades before, such as predictions about mode mixing in the interior of red-giant stars, among many others, now had voluminous precision data against which it could be tested. The overwhelming result is the general validation of the theory of stellar oscillations as well as stellar-structure models; however, important gaps in our understanding of interior physics was also revealed by Kepler. For example, interior rotation, convection, and mixing processes are complex phenomena not fully captured by standard models. This review explores some of the important impacts Kepler observations of solar-like oscillations across the cool end of the H-R diagram has had on stellar astrophysics through the use of asteroseismology.",
"After hydrogen and helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen\u2014hereinafter, the CNO elements\u2014are the most abundant species in the universe. They are observed in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the constituents of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review, I will summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies, starting from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in stars, I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model predictions and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in stars and in the gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations, as well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth of abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to the interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein, I will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes of the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where more direct estimates from the starlight are unfeasible.",
" We review the use of emission lines for understanding galaxy evolution, focusing on excitation source, metallicity, ionization parameter, ISM pressure, and electron density. We discuss the physics, benefits, and caveats of emission line diagnostics, including the effects of theoretical model uncertainties, diffuse ionized gas, and sample selection bias. In anticipation of upcoming telescope facilities, we provide new self-consistent emission line diagnostic calibrations for complete spectral coverage from the UV to the IR. These diagnostics can be used in concert to understand how fundamental galaxy properties have changed across cosmic time. We conclude the following: \u25aa The UV, optical, and IR contain complementary diagnostics that can probe the conditions within different nebular ionization zones. \u25aa Accounting for complex density gradients and temperature profiles is critical for reliably estimating the fundamental properties of Hii regions and galaxies. \u25aa Diffuse ionized gas can raise metallicity estimates, flatten metallicity gradients, and introduce scatter in ionization parameter measurements. \u25aa New 3D emission line diagnostics successfully separate the contributions from star formation, AGN, and shocks using integral field spectroscopy.

"The search for life in Solar System bodies such as Mars and Ocean Worlds (e.g., Europa and Enceladus) is an ongoing and high-priority endeavor in space science, even \u223c five decades after the first life detection mission at Mars performed by the twin Viking landers.

"We used high-resolution HST imaging ande-MERLIN 1.5-GHz observations of galaxy cores from the LeMMINGs survey to investigate the relation between optical structural properties and nuclear radio emission for a large sample of galaxies. We performed accurate, multi-component decompositions of new surface brightness profiles extracted from HST images for 163 LeMMINGs galaxies and fitted up to six galaxy components (e.g. bulges, discs, AGN, bars, rings, spiral arms, and nuclear star clusters) simultaneously with S\u00e9rsic and/or core-S\u00e9rsic models. By adding such decomposition data for ten LeMMINGs galaxies from our past work, the final sample of 173 nearby galaxies (102 Ss, 42 S0s, 23 Es, plus six Irr) with a typical bulge stellar mass ofM\u2217,bulge\u223c 106\u2212 1012.5M\u2299encompasses all optical spectral classes: low-ionisation nuclear emission-line region (LINER), Seyfert, Absorption Line Galaxy (ALG), and H\u202fII. We show that the bulge mass can be significantly overestimated in many galaxies when components such as bars, rings, and spirals are not included in the fits. We additionally implemented a Monte Carlo method to determine errors on the bulge, disc, and other fitted structural parameters. Moving (in the opposite direction) across the Hubble sequence, that is from the irregular to elliptical galaxies, we confirm that bulges become larger, more prominent, and round. Such bulge dominance is associated with a brighter radio core luminosity. We also find that the radio detection fraction increases with bulge mass. AtM\u2217,bulge\u2265 1011M\u2299, the radio detection fraction is 77%, declining to 24% forM\u2217,bulge< 1010M\u2299. Furthermore, we observe that core-S\u00e9rsic bulges tend to be systematically round and to possess high radio core luminosities and boxy-distorted or pure elliptical isophotes. However, there is no evidence for the previously alleged strong tendency of galaxies\u2019 central structures (i.e. a sharp S\u00e9rsic, core-S\u00e9rsic dichotomy) with their radio loudness, isophote shape, and flattening.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Turbulence affects the structure and motions of nearly all temperature and density regimes in the interstellar gas. This two-part review summarizes the observations, theory, and simulations of interstellar turbulence and their implications for many fields of astrophysics. The first part begins with diagnostics for turbulence that have been applied to the cool interstellar medium and highlights their main results. The energy sources for interstellar turbulence are then summarized along with numerical estimates for their power input. Supernovae and superbubbles dominate the total power, but many other sources spanning a large range of scales, from swing-amplified gravitational instabilities to cosmic ray streaming, all contribute in some way. Turbulence theory is considered in detail, including the basic fluid equations, solenoidal and compressible modes, global inviscid quadratic invariants, scaling arguments for the power spectrum, phenomenological models for the scaling of higher-order structure functions, the direction and locality of energy transfer and cascade, velocity probability distributions, and turbulent pressure. We emphasize expected differences between incompressible and compressible turbulence. Theories of magnetic turbulence on scales smaller than the collision mean free path are included, as are theories of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and their various proposals for power spectra. Numerical simulations of interstellar turbulence are reviewed. Models have reproduced the basic features of the observed scaling relations, predicted fast decay rates for supersonic MHD turbulence, and derived probability distribution functions for density. Thermal instabilities and thermal phases have a new interpretation in a supersonically turbulent medium. Large-scale models with various combinations of self-gravity, magnetic fields, supernovae, and star formation are beginning to resemble the observed interstellar medium in morphology and statistical properties. The role of self-gravity in turbulent gas evolution is clarified, leading to new paradigms for the formation of star clusters, the stellar mass function, the origin of stellar rotation and binary stars, and the effects of magnetic fields. The review ends with a reflection on the progress that has been made in our understanding of the interstellar medium and offers a list of outstanding problems.",
"We review the properties of the established Scaling Relations (SRs) of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on their origin and expected evolution back in time, providing a short history of the most important progresses obtained up to now and discussing the possible future studies. We also try to connect the observed SRs with the physical mechanisms behind them, examining to what extent current models reproduce the observational data. The emerging picture clarifies the complexity intrinsic to the galaxy formation and evolution process as well as the basic uncertainties still affecting our knowledge of the AGN phenomenon. At the same time, however, it suggests that the detailed analysis of the SRs can profitably contribute to our understanding of galaxies and AGN.",
" We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types\u2014spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems\u2014and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys. ",
" Exoplanetary science is on the verge of an unprecedented revolution. The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. \u25aa We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. \u25aa Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. \u25aa Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. \u25aa Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. \u25aa The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area. ",
" The construct of active learning permeates undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but despite its prevalence, the construct means different things to different people, groups, and STEM domains. To better understand active learning, we constructed this review through an innovative interdisciplinary collaboration involving research teams from psychology and discipline-based education research (DBER). Our collaboration examined active learning from two different perspectives (i.e., psychology and DBER) and surveyed the current landscape of undergraduate STEM instructional practices related to the modes of active learning and traditional lecture. On that basis, we concluded that active learning\u2014which is commonly used to communicate an alternative to lecture and does serve a purpose in higher education classroom practice\u2014is an umbrella term that is not particularly useful in advancing research on learning. To clarify, we synthesized a working definition of active learning that operates within an elaborative framework, which we call the construction-of-understanding ecosystem. A cornerstone of this framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual cognitive construction of knowledge. Our proposed framework offers a coherent and actionable concept of active learning with the aim of advancing future research and practice in undergraduate STEM education. ",
"Cluster substructure and ram pressure stripping in individual galaxies are among the primary pieces of evidence for the ongoing growth of galaxy clusters as they accrete galaxies and groups from their surroundings. We present a multiwavelength study of the center of the Hydra I galaxy cluster, including exquisite new MeerKAT H\u202fIand DECam H\u03b1imaging which reveal conclusive evidence for ram pressure stripping in NGC 3312, NGC 3314a, and NGC 3314b through compressed H\u202fIcontours, well-defined H\u202fItails, and ongoing star formation in the stripped gas. In particular, we quantify the stripped material in NGC 3312, and NGC 3314a, which makes up between 8% and 35% of the gas still in the disk, is forming stars at \u223c0.5M\u2299yr\u22121, and extends \u223c30\u221260 kpc from the main disk. The estimated stellar mass in the tails is an order of magnitude less than the H\u202fImass. A fourth \u201cring\u201d galaxy at the same velocity does not show signs of ram pressure in H\u202fI. In addition, we used the H\u202fIand stellar morphologies, combined with a Beta model of the hot intracluster medium, to constrain the real distances of the galaxies to the cluster center, and we used the chance alignment of NGC 3314b behind NGC 3314a to break the degeneracy between whether the galaxies are in front or in back of the cluster. The drag seen in the H\u202fItails supports our preferred scenario that NGC 3312 and NGC 3314a are moving toward us as part of a foreground substructure which has already passed its pericenter and is on \u201cout fall\u201d from the cluster. The high surviving H\u202fIcontent of the galaxies may suggest that the substructure or intragroup medium can protect them from the harshest effects of ram pressure, or that the galaxies are in fact on more tangential orbits.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Observations of parsec-scale radio jets associated with active galactic nuclei are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on high-luminosity core-dominated sources where the most detailed information on individual objects exists. Extensive imaging surveys with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have made possible a morphologic classification of compact radio sources and systematic studies of the statistics of apparent (often faster-than-light) motions found in an increasing number of sources. VLBI monitoring studies at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths, enhanced by spectral and polarization imaging, of representative types of AGN can discriminate detailed physical models. The observations are especially discussed in light of the variant of the relativistic beaming model that explains kinematic, spectral, and polarization properties of parsec-scale jets through shocks in an underlying continuous jet flow.",
"The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond (\u03bcas) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 \u03bcas, even challenging 1 \u03bcas. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.",
"Subject and Purpose. The subject of this paper is to review the principal methods of fractal and multifractal analysis of signals and processes, in combination with a detailed consideration of the algorithms that can provide for a successful practical implementation of the methods described. Methods and Methodology. The results presented concern modeling of both deterministic and stochastic fractal and multifractal signals and processes. The corresponding practical methods of analysis are considered, with discussion of their essential features, advantages and disadvantages, as well as of the problems of application that may exist. Results. Several approaches have been discussed as to categorizing the signals and processes within the notion of fractality. A few tens of models of deterministic and stochastic fractal or multifractal signals and processes have been analyzed in detail. Over twenty methods of monofractal analysis have been analyzed, with identifi cation of their features, advantages or disadvantages, and limits of applicability. The expediency of resorting to complex methods of monofractal analysis has also been discussed. Those methods are not based upon application of fractal analysis techniques alone but rather combine them with linear and nonlinear integral time-frequency transforms. The effectiveness of the ten most popular multifractal analysis techniques has been confirmed, with consideration of their special features, advantages and drawbacks. Conclusion. The mathematical foundations have been presented which underlie modern methods of analysis and modeling of fractal and multifractal signals and processes. The methods discussed may allow revealing a great amount of unique hidden information on the world around us.",
"Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic \u201cfeedback\u201d from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes\u2014generally unresolved in cosmological simulations\u2014plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.",
"Context. LDN 1157 is one of several clouds that are situated in the cloud complex LDN 1147/1158. The cloud presents a coma-shaped morphology with a well-collimated bipolar outflow emanating from a Class 0 protostar, LDN 1157-mm, that resides deep inside the cloud.Aims. The main goals of this work are (a) mapping the intercloud magnetic field (ICMF) geometry of the region surrounding LDN 1157 to investigate its relationship with the cloud morphology, outflow direction, and core magnetic field (CMF) geometry inferred from the millimeter- and submillimeter polarization results from the literature, and (b) to investigate the kinematic structure of the cloud.Methods. We carried out optical (R-band) polarization observations of the stars projected on the cloud to map the parsec-scale magnetic field geometry. We made spectroscopic observations of the entire cloud in the 12CO, C18O, and N2H+ (J = 1\u20130) lines to investigate its kinematic structure.Results. We obtained a distance of 340 \u00b1 3 pc to the LDN 1147/1158, complex based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motion values of the three young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the complex. A single filament of ~1.2 pc in length (traced by the Filfinder algorithm) and ~0.09 pc in width (estimated using the Radfil algorithm) is found to run throughout the coma-shaped cloud. Based on the relationships between the ICMF, CMF, filament orientations, outflow direction, and the hourglass morphology of the magnetic field, it is likely that the magnetic field played an important role in the star formation process in LDN 1157. LDN 1157-mm is embedded in one of the two high-density peaks detected using the Clumpfind algorithm. The two detected clumps lie on the filament and show a blue-red asymmetry in the 12CO line. The C18O emission is well correlated with the filament and presents a coherent structure in velocity space. Combining the proper motions of the YSOs and the radial velocity of LDN 1147/1158 and an another complex, LDN 1172/1174, that is situated ~2\u00b0 east of it, we found that the two complexes are moving collectively toward the Galactic plane. The filamentary morphology of the east-west segment of LDN 1157 may have formed as a result of mass lost by ablation through interaction of the moving cloud with the ambient interstellar medium.",
"Aims.Thanks to the high angular resolution, sensitivity, image fidelity, and frequency coverage of ALMA, we aim to improve our understanding of star formation. One of the breakthroughs expected from ALMA, which is the basis of our Cycle 5 ALMA-IMF Large Program, is the question of the origin of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars. Here we present the ALMA-IMF protocluster selection, first results, and scientific prospects.Methods.ALMA-IMF imaged a total noncontiguous area of ~53 pc2, covering extreme, nearby protoclusters of the Milky Way. We observed 15 massive (2.5 \u221233 \u00d7 103M\u2299), nearby (2\u22125.5 kpc) protoclusters that were selected to span relevant early protocluster evolutionary stages. Our 1.3 and 3 mm observations provide continuum images that are homogeneously sensitive to point-like cores with masses of ~0.2M\u2299and ~0.6M\u2299, respectively, with a matched spatial resolution of ~2000 au across the sample at both wavelengths. Moreover, with the broad spectral coverage provided by ALMA, we detect lines that probe the ionized and molecular gas, as well as complex molecules. Taken together, these data probe the protocluster structure, kinematics, chemistry, and feedback over scales from clouds to filaments to cores.Results.We classify ALMA-IMF protoclusters as Young (six protoclusters), Intermediate (five protoclusters), or Evolved (four proto-clusters) based on the amount of dense gas in the cloud that has potentially been impacted by H\u202fIIregion(s). The ALMA-IMF catalog contains ~700 cores that span a mass range of ~0.15M\u2299to ~250M\u2299at a typical size of ~2100 au. We show that this core sample has no significant distance bias and can be used to build core mass functions (CMFs) at similar physical scales. Significant gas motions, which we highlight here in the G353.41 region, are traced down to core scales and can be used to look for inflowing gas streamers and to quantify the impact of the possible associated core mass growth on the shape of the CMF with time. Our first analysis does not reveal any significant evolution of the matter concentration from clouds to cores (i.e., from 1 pc to 0.01 pc scales) or from the youngest to more evolved protoclusters, indicating that cloud dynamical evolution and stellar feedback have for the moment only had a slight effect on the structure of high-density gas in our sample. Furthermore, the first-look analysis of the line richness toward bright cores indicates that the survey encompasses several tens of hot cores, of which we highlight the most massive in the G351.77 cloud. Their homogeneous characterization can be used to constrain the emerging molecular complexity in protostars of high to intermediate masses.Conclusions.The ALMA-IMF Large Program is uniquely designed to transform our understanding of the IMF origin, taking the effects of cloud characteristics and evolution into account. It will provide the community with an unprecedented database with a high legacy value for protocluster clouds, filaments, cores, hot cores, outflows, inflows, and stellar clusters studies.",
"Research into the cosmic synthesis of the elements, the evolution and explosion of stars, the nature of the early Universe, and other important topics in nuclear astrophysics are at the forefront of nuclear science. These studies are motivating laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations that, after significant investments, are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The latest nuclear results, however, must be specially prepared before they can be used to advance our knowledge of the cosmos. This processing requires a set of resources unique to nuclear astrophysics, and an impressive collection of nuclear reaction and nuclear structure datasets, processing codes, thermonuclear reaction rate libraries, and simulation codes and services have been developed for the field. There are, however, some serious challenges to these efforts that will only worsen in the future, making it important to develop strategies and act now to ensure a sustainable future for this work. After detailing the specific data types needed for nuclear astrophysics and the available data resources, the major challenges in this work and their implications are discussed. A set of initiatives are proposed to meet those challenges along with suggested implementations and possible ways that they may advance our understanding of the Universe and strengthen the field of nuclear astrophysics.",
"We review the current knowledge about nuclear star clusters (NSCs), the spectacularly dense and massive assemblies of stars found at the centers of most galaxies. Recent observational and theoretical works suggest that many NSC properties, including their masses, densities, and stellar populations, vary with the properties of their host galaxies. Understanding the formation, growth, and ultimate fate of NSCs, therefore, is crucial for a complete picture of galaxy evolution. Throughout the review, we attempt to combine and distill the available evidence into a coherent picture of NSC evolution. Combined, this evidence points to a clear transition mass in galaxies of$$\\sim 10^9\\,M_\\odot$$\u223c109M\u2299where the characteristics of nuclear star clusters change. We argue that at lower masses, NSCs are formed primarily from globular clusters that inspiral into the center of the galaxy, while at higher masses, star formation within the nucleus forms the bulk of the NSC. We also discuss the co-existence of NSCs and central black holes, and how their growth may be linked. The extreme densities of NSCs and their interaction with massive black holes lead to a wide range of unique phenomena including tidal disruption and gravitational-wave events. Finally, we review the evidence that many NSCs end up in the halos of massive galaxies stripped of the stars that surrounded them, thus providing valuable tracers of the galaxies\u2019 accretion histories.",
" The New Horizons (NH) flyby of the Pluto\u2013Charon binary planet and its system of four small surrounding satellites in mid-2015 revolutionized our knowledge of this distant planet and its moons. Beyond providing rich geo-logical, compositional, and atmospheric data sets, NH demonstrated that Pluto has been surprisingly geologically and climatologically active throughout the past 4+ Gyr and that the planet exhibits a remarkably complex range of atmospheric phenomenology and geological expressions that rival Mars in their richness. In contrast, Pluto's large, planet-sized satellite Charon, though also geologically complex, has no detected active surface volatiles, has no detectable atmosphere, has much more muted colors, has lower albedo, and exhibits only ancient terrains. Pluto's system of four small satellites orbiting outside of Charon is itself dynamically complex and geologically interesting. Here, we review both what was known about the Pluto system before NH and what it has taught us about the Pluto system specifically and, by inference, other small planets in the Kuiper Belt. We go on to examine the natural next steps in Kuiper Belt exploration. ",
"Hydrogen-rich supernovae, known as Type II (SNe II), are the most common class of explosions observed following the collapse of the core of massive stars. We used analytical estimates and population synthesis simulations to assess the fraction of SNe II progenitors that are expected to have exchanged mass with a companion prior to explosion. We estimate that 1/3 to 1/2 of SN II progenitors have a history of mass exchange with a binary companion before exploding. The dominant binary channels leading to SN II progenitors involve the merger of binary stars. Mergers are expected to produce a diversity of SN II progenitor characteristics, depending on the evolutionary timing and properties of the merger. Alternatively, SN II progenitors from interacting binaries may have accreted mass from their companion, and subsequently been ejected from the binary system after their companion exploded. We show that the overall fraction of SN II progenitors that are predicted to have experienced binary interaction is robust against the main physical uncertainties in our models. However, the relative importance of different binary evolutionary channels is affected by changing physical assumptions. We further discuss ways in which binarity might contribute to the observed diversity of SNe II by considering potential observational signatures arising from each binary channel. For supernovae which have a substantial H-rich envelope at explosion (i.e., excluding Type IIb SNe), a surviving non-compact companion would typically indicate that the supernova progenitor star was in a wide, non-interacting binary. We argue that a significant fraction of even Type II-P SNe are expected to have gained mass from a companion prior to explosion.",
"Context.GaiaDR3 contains 1.8 billion sources withG-band photometry, 1.5 billion of which withGBPandGRPphotometry, complemented by positions on the sky, parallax, and proper motion. The median number of field-of-view transits in the three photometric bands is between 40 and 44 measurements per source and covers 34 months of data collection.Aims.We pursue a classification of Galactic and extra-galactic objects that are detected as variable byGaiaacross the whole sky.Methods.Supervised machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) was employed to generate multi-class, binary, and meta-classifiers that classified variable objects with photometric time series in theG,GBP, andGRPbands.Results.Classification results comprise 12.4 million sources (selected from a much larger set of potential variable objects) and include about 9 million variable stars classified into 22 variability types in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda, plus thousands of supernova explosions in distant galaxies, 1 million active galactic nuclei, and almost 2.5 million galaxies. The identification of galaxies was made possible by the artificial variability of extended objects as detected byGaia, so they were published in thegalaxy_candidatestable of theGaiaDR3 archive, separate from the classifications of genuine variability (in thevari_classifier_resulttable). The latter contains 24 variability classes or class groups of periodic and non-periodic variables (pulsating, eclipsing, rotating, eruptive, cataclysmic, stochastic, and microlensing), with amplitudes from a few milli-magnitudes to several magnitudes.",
"Linking supernovae to their progenitors is a powerful method for furthering our understanding of the physical origin of their observed differences while at the same time testing stellar evolution theory. In this second study of a series of three papers where we characterise type II supernovae (SNe II) to understand their diversity, we derive progenitor properties (initial and ejecta masses and radius), explosion energy, and56Ni mass and its degree of mixing within the ejecta for a large sample of SNe II. This dataset was obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-I and is characterised by a high cadence of SNe II optical and near-infrared light curves and optical spectra that were homogeneously observed and processed. A large grid of hydrodynamical models and a fitting procedure based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to fit the bolometric light curve and the evolution of the photospheric velocity of 53 SNe II. We infer ejecta masses of between 7.9 and 14.8M\u2299, explosion energies between 0.15 and 1.40 foe, and56Ni masses between 0.006 and 0.069M\u2299. We define a subset of 24 SNe (the \u2018gold sample\u2019) with well-sampled bolometric light curves and expansion velocities for which we consider the results more robust. Most SNe II in the gold sample (\u223c88%) are found with ejecta masses in the range of \u223c8\u221210M\u2299, coming from low zero-age main-sequence masses (9\u221212M\u2299). The modelling of the initial-mass distribution of the gold sample gives an upper mass limit of 21.3$ ^{+3.8}_{-0.4} $M\u2299and a much steeper distribution than that for a Salpeter massive-star initial mass function (IMF). This IMF incompatibility is due to the large number of low-mass progenitors found \u2013 when assuming standard stellar evolution. This may imply that high-mass progenitors lose more mass during their lives than predicted. However, a deeper analysis of all stellar evolution assumptions is required to test this hypothesis.",
"Since the year 2000, adaptive optics (AO) has seen the emergence of a variety of new concepts addressing particular science needs; multiconjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) is one of them. By correcting the atmospheric turbulence in 3D using several wavefront sensors and a tomographic phase reconstruction approach, MCAO aims to provide uniform diffraction limited images in the near-infrared over fields of view larger than 1 arcmin2, i.e., 10 to 20 times larger in area than classical single conjugated AO. In this review, we give a brief reminder of the AO principles and limitations, and then focus on aspects particular to MCAO, such as tomography and specific MCAO error sources. We present examples and results from past or current systems: MAD (Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator) and GeMS (Gemini MCAO System) for nighttime astronomy and the AO system, at Big Bear for solar astronomy. We examine MCAO performance (Strehl ratio up to 40% in H band and full width at half maximum down to 52 mas in the case of MCAO), with a particular focus on photometric and astrometric accuracy, and conclude with considerations on the future of MCAO in the Extremely Large Telescope and post\u2013HST era.",
"Structures in the solar wind result from two basic mechanisms: structures injected or imposed directly by the Sun, and structures formed through processing en route as the solar wind advects outward and fills the heliosphere. On the largest scales, solar structures directly impose heliospheric structures, such as coronal holes imposing high speed streams of solar wind. Transient solar processes can inject large-scale structure directly into the heliosphere as well, such as coronal mass ejections. At the smallest, kinetic scales, the solar wind plasma continually evolves, converting energy into heat, and all structure at these scales is formed en route. \u201cMesoscale\u201d structures, with scales at 1\u00a0AU in the approximate spatial range of 5\u201310,000\u00a0Mm and temporal range of 10\u00a0s\u20137\u00a0h, lie in the orders of magnitude gap between the two size-scale extremes. Structures of this size regime are created through both mechanisms. Competition between the imposed and injected structures with turbulent and other evolution leads to complex structuring and dynamics. The goal is to understand this interplay and to determine which type of mesoscale structures dominate the solar wind under which conditions. However, the mesoscale regime is also the region of observation space that is grossly under-sampled. The sparse in situ measurements that currently exist are only able to measure individual instances of discrete structures, and are not capable of following their evolution or spatial extent. Remote imaging has captured global and large scale features and their evolution, but does not yet have the sensitivity to measure most mesoscale structures and their evolution. Similarly, simulations cannot model the global system while simultaneously resolving kinetic effects. It is important to understand the source and evolution of solar wind mesoscale structures because they contain information on how the Sun forms the solar wind, and constrains the physics of turbulent processes. Mesoscale structures also comprise the ground state of space weather, continually buffeting planetary magnetospheres. In this paper we describe the current understanding of the formation and evolution mechanisms of mesoscale structures in the solar wind, their characteristics, implications, and future steps for research progress on this topic.",
"Aims.Various nucleosynthesis studies have pointed out that ther-process elements in very metal-poor (VMP) halo stars might have different origins. By means of familiar concepts from statistics (correlations, cluster analysis, and rank tests of elemental abundances), we look for causally correlated elemental abundance patterns and attempt to link them to astrophysical events. Some of these events produce ther-process elements jointly with iron, while others do not have any significant iron contribution. We try to (a) characterize these different types of events by their abundance patterns and (b) identify them among the existing set of suggestedr-process sites.Methods.The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were used in order to investigate correlations amongr-process elements (X,Y) as well as their relation to iron (Fe) in VMP halo stars. We gradually tracked the evolution of those coefficients in terms of the element enrichments [X/Fe] or [X/Y] and the metallicity [Fe/H]. This approach, aided by cluster analysis to find different structures of abundance patterns and rank tests to identify whether several events contributed to the observed pattern, is new and provides deeper insights into the abundances of VMP stars.Results.In the early stage of our Galaxy, at least threer-process nucleosynthesis sites have been active. The first two produce and eject iron and the majority of the lighterr-process elements. We assign them to two different types of core-collapse events, not identical to regular core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which produce only light trans-Fe elements. The third category is characterized by a strongr-process and is responsible for the major fraction of the heavy mainr-process elements without a significant coproduction of Fe. It does not appear to be connected to CCSNe, in fact most of the Fe found in the relatedr-process enriched stars must come from previously occurring CCSNe. The existence of actinide boost stars indicates a further division among strongr-process sites. We assign these two strongr-process sites to neutron star mergers without fast black hole formation and to events where the ejecta are dominated by black hole accretion disk outflows. Indications from the lowest-metallicity stars hint at a connection with massive single stars (collapsars) forming black holes in the early Galaxy.",
" Low-mass stars in their core-helium-burning stage define the sharpest feature present in the color-magnitude diagrams of nearby galaxy systems: the red clump (RC). This feature has given rise to a series of methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge. Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature. ",
"Context.Through observations numerous giant molecular filaments (GMFs) have been discovered in the Milky Way. Their role in the Galactic star formation and Galaxy-scale evolution of dense gas is unknown.Aims.We investigate systematically the star-forming content of all currently known GMFs. This allows us to estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) of the GMFs and to establish relationships between the SFRs and the GMF properties.Methods.We identified and classified the young stellar object (YSO) population of each GMF using multiwavelength photometry from near- to far-infrared. We estimated the total SFRs assuming a universal and fully sampled initial mass function and luminosity function.Results.We uniformly estimate the physical properties of 57 GMFs. The GMFs show correlations between the13CO line width, mass, and size, similar to Larson\u2019s relations. We identify 36 394 infrared excess sources in 57 GMFs and obtain SFRs for 46 GMFs. The median SFR surface density (\u03a3SFR) and star formation efficiency (SFE) of GMFs are 0.62M\u2299Myr\u22121pc\u22122and 1%, similar to the nearby star-forming clouds. The star formation rate per free-fall time of GMFs is between 0.002\u22120.05 with the median value of 0.02. We also find a strong correlation between SFR and dense gas mass that is defined as gas mass above a visual extinction of 7 mag, which suggests that the SFRs of the GMFs scale similarly with dense gas as those of nearby molecular clouds. We also find a strong correlation between the mean SFR per unit length and dense gas mass per unit length. The origin of this scaling remains unknown, calling for further studies that can link the structure of GMFs to their SF activity and explore the differences between GMFs and other molecular clouds.",
"Context. Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are short-duration (\u223cks) X-ray flashes of unknown origin, potentially arising from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, tidal disruption events, or supernova shock breakouts.Aims. In the context of the BNS scenario, we investigate the possible link between FXTs and the afterglows of off-axis merger-induced gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).Methods. By modelling well-sampled broadband afterglows of 13 merger-induced GRBs, we make predictions for their X-ray light curve behaviour had they been observed off-axis, considering both a uniform jet with core angle \u03b8C and a Gaussian-structured jet whose edge lies at an angle \u03b8W\u2004=\u20042\u03b8C. We compare their peak X-ray luminosity, duration, and temporal indices \u03b1 (where F\u2004\u221d\u2004t\u03b1) with those of the currently known extragalactic FXTs.Results. Our analysis reveals that a slightly off-axis observing angle of \u03b8obs\u2004\u2248\u2004(2.2\u2005\u2212\u20053)\u03b8C and a structured jet are required to explain the shallow (|\u03b1|\u22720.3) temporal indices of the FXT light curves, which cannot be reproduced in the uniform-jet case at any viewing angle. In the case of a structured jet with truncation angle \u03b8W\u2004=\u20042\u03b8C, the distributions of the duration of the FXTs are consistent with those of the off-axis afterglows for the same range of observing angles, \u03b8obs\u2004\u2248\u2004(2.2\u2005\u2212\u20053)\u03b8C. While the distributions of the off-axis peak X-ray luminosity are consistent only for \u03b8obs\u2004=\u20042.2\u03b8C, focussing on individual events with different intrinsic luminosities reveals that the match of all three properties (peak X-ray luminosity, duration and temporal indices) of the FXTs at the same viewing angle is possible in the range \u03b8obs\u2004\u223c\u2004(2.2\u2005\u2212\u20052.6)\u03b8C. Despite the small sample of GRBs analysed, these results show that there is a region of the parameter space \u2013 although quite limited \u2013 where the observational properties of off-axis GRB afterglow can be consistent with those of the newly discovered FXTs. Future observations of FXTs discovered by the recently launched Einstein Probe mission and GRB population studies combined with more complex afterglow models will shed light on this possible GRB-FXT connection, and eventually unveil the progenitors of some FXTs.",
"Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are believed to be active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early stages of their evolution. Several dozen of them have been found to host relativistic jets, whilst the majority of NLS1s have not even been detected in radio, emphasising the heterogeneity of the class in this band. In this paper, our aim is to determine the predominant source of radio emission in a sample of 44 NLS1s, selected based on their extended kiloparsec-scale radio morphologies at 5.2 GHz. We accomplish this by analysing their spatially resolved radio spectral index maps, centred at 5.2 GHz, as the spectral index carries information about the production mechanisms of the emission. In addition, we utilise several diagnostics based on mid-infrared emission to estimate the star formation activity of their host galaxies. These data are complemented by archival data to draw a more complete picture of each source. We find an extraordinary diversity among our sample. Approximately equal fractions (\u223c10\u201312 sources) of our sources can be identified as AGN-dominated, composite, and host-dominated. Among the AGN-dominated sources are a few NLS1s with very extended jets, reaching distances of tens of kiloparsecs from the nucleus. One of these, J0814+5609, hosts the most extended jets found in an NLS1 so far. We also identify five NLS1s that could be classified as compact steep-spectrum sources. In addition, one source shows a possible kiloparsec-scale relic that reaches well outside the host galaxy as well as restarted nuclear activity, and one could belong to the sub-class of NLS1s that host relativistic jets that seem to be absorbed at lower radio frequencies (< 10 GHz). We further conclude that, due to the variety seen in NLS1s, simple proxies, such as the star formation diagnostics also employed in this paper and the radio loudness parameter, are not ideal tools for characterising NLS1s. We emphasise the necessity of examining NLS1s as individuals instead of making assumptions based on their classification. When these issues are properly taken into account, NLS1s offer an exceptional environment for studying the interplay between the host galaxy and several AGN-related phenomena, such as jets and outflows.",
"Within the precise cosmological framework provided by the \u039b-cold dark matter model and standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the chemical evolution of the pregalactic gas can now be followed with accuracy limited only by the uncertainties on the reaction rates. Starting during the recombination era, the formation of the first molecules and molecular ions containing hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium was severely hindered by the low density of the expanding Universe, the intensity of the cosmic radiation field, and the absence of solid catalyzers. Molecular hydrogen and deuterated hydrogen, the most abundant species formed in the gas phase prior to structure formation, played a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas clouds that gave birth to the first stellar generation, contributing to determine the scale of fragmentation. Primordial molecules also interacted with the photons of the cosmic background via resonant scattering, absorption, and emission. In this review, we examine the current status of the chemistry of the early Universe and discuss the most relevant reactions for which uncertainties still exist from theory or laboratory experiments. The prospects for detecting spectral distortions or spatial anisotropies due to the first atoms and molecules are also addressed.",
"Aims. Current hydrodynamical and semi-empirical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have difficulties in reproducing the number densities of infrared-detected galaxies. Therefore, a phenomenological simulation tool that is new and versatile is necessary to reproduce current and predict future observations at infrared (IR) wavelengths.Methods. In this work we generate simulated catalogues starting from the Herschel IR luminosity functions of different galaxy populations to consider different populations of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a consistent way. We associated a spectral energy distribution and physical properties, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and AGN contribution, with each simulated galaxy using a broad set of empirical relations. We compared the resulting simulated galaxies, extracted up to z\u2004=\u200410, with a broad set of observational relations.Results. Spectro-Photometric Realisations of IR-Selected Targets at all-z (SPRITZ) simulations allow us to obtain, in a fully consistent way, simulated observations for a broad set of current and future facilities with photometric capabilities as well as low-resolution IR spectroscopy, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the Origin Space Telescope (OST). The derived simulated catalogue contains galaxies and AGN that by construction reproduce the observed IR galaxy number density, but this catalogue also agrees with the observed number counts from UV to far-IR wavelengths, the observed stellar mass function, the star formation rate versus stellar mass plane, and the luminosity function from the radio to X-ray wavelengths. The proposed simulation is therefore ideal to make predictions for current and future facilities, in particular, but not limited to, those operating at IR wavelengths.",
"The H0LiCOW collaboration inferred via strong gravitational lensing time delays a Hubble constant value of H0 = 73.3\u22121.8+1.7 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, describing deflector mass density profiles by either a power-law or stars (constant mass-to-light ratio) plus standard dark matter halos. The mass-sheet transform (MST) that leaves the lensing observables unchanged is considered the dominant source of residual uncertainty in H0. We quantify any potential effect of the MST with a flexible family of mass models, which directly encodes it, and they are hence maximally degenerate with H0. Our calculation is based on a new hierarchical Bayesian approach in which the MST is only constrained by stellar kinematics. The approach is validated on mock lenses, which are generated from hydrodynamic simulations. We first applied the inference to the TDCOSMO sample of seven lenses, six of which are from H0LiCOW, and measured H0 = 74.5\u22126.1+5.6 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. Secondly, in order to further constrain the deflector mass density profiles, we added imaging and spectroscopy for a set of 33 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample. For nine of the 33 SLAC lenses, we used resolved kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint hierarchical analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample, we measured H0 = 67.4\u22123.2+4.1 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. This measurement assumes that the TDCOSMO and SLACS galaxies are drawn from the same parent population. The blind H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO-only and TDCOSMO+SLACS analyses are in mutual statistical agreement. The TDCOSMO+SLACS analysis prefers marginally shallower mass profiles than H0LiCOW or TDCOSMO-only. Without relying on the form of the mass density profile used by H0LiCOW, we achieve a \u223c5% measurement of H0. While our new hierarchical analysis does not statistically invalidate the mass profile assumptions by H0LiCOW \u2013 and thus the H0 measurement relying on them \u2013 it demonstrates the importance of understanding the mass density profile of elliptical galaxies. The uncertainties on H0 derived in this paper can be reduced by physical or observational priors on the form of the mass profile, or by additional data.",
"In order to evaluate how much Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) has influenced Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends, it is important to have reliable estimates of both quantities. Sixteen different estimates of the changes in TSI since at least the 19th century were compiled from the literature. Half of these estimates are \u201clow variability\u201d and half are \u201chigh variability\u201d. Meanwhile, five largely-independent methods for estimating Northern Hemisphere temperature trends were evaluated using: 1) only rural weather stations; 2) all available stations whether urban or rural (the standard approach); 3) only sea surface temperatures; 4) tree-ring widths as temperature proxies; 5) glacier length records as temperature proxies. The standard estimates which use urban as well as rural stations were somewhat anomalous as they implied a much greater warming in recent decades than the other estimates, suggesting that urbanization bias might still be a problem in current global temperature datasets \u2013 despite the conclusions of some earlier studies. Nonetheless, all five estimates confirm that it is currently warmer than the late 19th century, i.e., there has been some \u201cglobal warming\u201d since the 19th century. For each of the five estimates of Northern Hemisphere temperatures, the contribution from direct solar forcing for all sixteen estimates of TSI was evaluated using simple linear least-squares fitting. The role of human activity on recent warming was then calculated by fitting the residuals to the UN IPCC\u2019s recommended \u201canthropogenic forcings\u201d time series. For all five Northern Hemisphere temperature series, different TSI estimates suggest everything from no role for the Sun in recent decades (implying that recent global warming is mostly human-caused) to most of the recent global warming being due to changes in solar activity (that is, that recent global warming is mostly natural). It appears that previous studies (including the most recent IPCC reports) which had prematurely concluded the former, had done so because they failed to adequately consider all the relevant estimates of TSI and/or to satisfactorily address the uncertainties still associated with Northern Hemisphere temperature trend estimates. Therefore, several recommendations on how the scientific community can more satisfactorily resolve these issues are provided.",
"The smallest characteristic scales, at which electron dynamics determines the plasma behaviour, are the next frontier in space and astrophysical plasma research. The analysis of astrophysical processes at these scales lies at the heart of the research theme of electron-astrophysics. Electron scales are the ultimate bottleneck for dissipation of plasma turbulence, which is a fundamental process not understood in the electron-kinetic regime. In addition, plasma electrons often play an important role for the spatial transfer of thermal energy due to the high heat flux associated with their velocity distribution. The regulation of this electron heat flux is likewise not understood. By focussing on these and other fundamental electron processes, the research theme of electron-astrophysics links outstanding science questions of great importance to the fields of space physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics. In this White Paper, submitted to ESA in response to the Voyage 2050 call, we review a selection of these outstanding questions, discuss their importance, and present a roadmap for answering them through novel space-mission concepts.",
"Context. Planet formation is sensitive to the conditions in protoplanetary disks, for which scaling laws as a function of stellar mass are known.Aims. We aim to test whether the observed population of planets around low-mass stars can be explained by these trends, or if separate formation channels are needed.Methods. We address this question by confronting a state-of-the-art planet population synthesis model with a sample of planets around M dwarfs observed by the HARPS and CARMENES radial velocity (RV) surveys. To account for detection biases, we performed injection and retrieval experiments on the actual RV data to produce synthetic observations of planets that we simulated following the core accretion paradigm.Results. These simulations robustly yield the previously reported high occurrence of rocky planets around M dwarfs and generally agree with their planetary mass function. In contrast, our simulations cannot reproduce a population of giant planets around stars less massive than 0.5 solar masses. This potentially indicates an alternative formation channel for giant planets around the least massive stars that cannot be explained with current core accretion theories. We further find a stellar mass dependency in the detection rate of short-period planets. A lack of close-in planets around the earlier-type stars (M* > 0.4 M\u2299) in our sample remains unexplained by our model and indicates dissimilar planet migration barriers in disks of different spectral subtypes.Conclusions. Both discrepancies can be attributed to gaps in our understanding of planet migration in nascent M dwarf systems. They underline the different conditions around young stars of different spectral subtypes, and the importance of taking these differences into account when studying planet formation.",
"We review our current understanding of how the first galaxies formed at the end of the cosmic dark ages a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.",
" Access to microarcsecond astrometry is now routine in the radio, infrared (IR), and optical domains.

" Cosmic dust is present in many astrophysical objects, and recent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum show that the dust distribution is often strongly three-dimensional (3D). Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field. ",
"Primordial non\u2010Gaussianity is a potentially powerful discriminant of the physical mechanisms that\ngenerated the cosmological fluctuations observed today. Any detection of significant non\u2010Gaussianity would thus have profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation. The large\u2010scale mass distribution in the Universe is a sensitive probe of the nature of initial conditions. Recent theoretical progress together with rapid developments in observational techniques will enable us to critically confront predictions of inflationary scenarios and set constraints as competitive as those from the Cosmic Microwave Background. In this paper, we review past and current efforts in the search for primordial non\u2010Gaussianity in the large\u2010scale structure of the Universe.",
"Context. Carbon stars have been, and still are, extensively studied. Given their complex internal structure and their peculiar chemical composition, they are living laboratories in which we can test stellar structure and evolution theories of evolved stars. Furthermore, they are the most relevant dust manufacturers, thus playing a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies.Aims. We aim to study the dust mineralogy of the circumstellar envelope of carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to achieve a better understanding of the dust formation process in the outflow of these objects. We intend to investigate the expected distribution of carbon stars in the observational planes built with the filters of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) mounted onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to select the best planes allowing an exhaustive characterisation of the stars.Methods. We compared the synthetic spectral energy distributions, obtained by modelling asymptotic giant branch stars and the dust formation process in the wind, with the spectra of carbon stars in the LMC, taken with the Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. From the detailed comparison between synthetic modelling and observation we characterise the individual sources and derive the detailed mineralogy of the dust in the circumstellar envelope.Results. The sample of stars considered here is composed of stars of diverse mass, formation epoch, degree of obscuration, and metallicity. We find that precipitation of MgS on SiC seeds is common to all non-metal-poor carbon stars. Solid carbon is the dominant dust component, with percentages above 80% in all cases; a percentage between 10% and 20% of carbon dust is under the form of graphite, the remaining being amorphous carbon. Regarding the observational planes based on the MIRI filters, the colour-magnitude ([F770W]\u2013[F1800W], [F1800W]) plane allows the best understanding of the degree of obscuration of the stars, while the ([F1800W]\u2013[F2550W], [F1800W]) diagram allows better discrimination among stars of different metallicities.",
"The dust-to-stellar mass ratio (Mdust/M\u22c6) is a crucial, albeit poorly constrained, parameter for improving our understanding of the complex physical processes involved in the production of dust, metals, and stars in galaxy evolution. In this work, we explore trends of Mdust/M\u22c6 with different physical parameters and using observations of 300 massive dusty star-forming galaxies detected with ALMA up to z\u2004\u2248\u20045. Additionally, we interpret our findings with different models of dusty galaxy formation. We find that Mdust/M\u22c6 evolves with redshift, stellar mass, specific star formation rates, and integrated dust size, but that evolution is different for main-sequence galaxies than it is for starburst galaxies. In both galaxy populations, Mdust/M\u22c6 increases until z\u2004\u223c\u20042, followed by a roughly flat trend towards higher redshifts, suggesting efficient dust growth in the distant universe. We confirm that the inverse relation between Mdust/M\u22c6 and M\u22c6 holds up to z\u2004\u2248\u20045 and can be interpreted as an evolutionary transition from early to late starburst phases. We demonstrate that the Mdust/M\u22c6 in starbursts reflects the increase in molecular gas fraction with redshift and attains the highest values for sources with the most compact dusty star formation. State-of-the-art cosmological simulations that include self-consistent dust growth have the capacity to broadly reproduce the evolution of Mdust/M\u22c6 in main-sequence galaxies, but underestimating it in starbursts. The latter is found to be linked to lower gas-phase metallicities and longer dust-growth timescales relative to observations. The results of phenomenological models based on the main-sequence and starburst dichotomy as well as analytical models that include recipes for rapid metal enrichment are consistent with our observations. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that high Mdust/M\u22c6 is due to rapid dust grain growth in the metal-enriched interstellar medium. This work highlights the multi-fold benefits of using Mdust/M\u22c6 as a diagnostic tool for: (1) disentangling main-sequence and starburst galaxies up to z\u2004\u223c\u20045; (2) probing the evolutionary phase of massive objects; and (3) refining the treatment of the dust life cycle in simulations.",
"Photometric redshifts are essential in studies of both galaxy evolution and cosmology, as they enable analyses of objects too numerous or faint for spectroscopy. The Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Roman Space Telescope will soon provide a new generation of imaging surveys with unprecedented area coverage, wavelength range, and depth. To take full advantage of these data sets, further progress in photometric redshift methods is needed. In this review, we focus on the greatest common challenges and prospects for improvement in applications of photometric redshifts to the next generation of surveys: \u25aa Gains in performance (i.e., the precision of redshift estimates for individual galaxies) could greatly enhance studies of galaxy evolution and some probes of cosmology. \u25aa Improvements in characterization (i.e., the accurate recovery of redshift distributions of galaxies in the presence of uncertainty on individual redshifts) are urgently needed for cosmological measurements with next-generation surveys.To achieve both of these goals, improvements in the scope and treatment of the samples of spectroscopic redshifts that make high-fidelity photometric redshifts possible will also be needed. For the full potential of the next generation of surveys to be reached, the characterization of redshift distributions must improve by roughly an order of magnitude compared with the current state of the art, requiring progress on a wide variety of fronts. We conclude by presenting a speculative evaluation of how photometric redshift methods and the collection of the necessary spectroscopic samples may improve by the time near-future surveys are completed.",
"Context.Stellar bars are known to gradually funnel gas to the central parts of disk galaxies. It remains a matter of debate why the distribution of ionized gas along bars and in the circumnuclear regions varies among galaxies.Aims.Our goal is to investigate the spatial distribution of star formation (SF) within bars of nearby low-inclination disk galaxies (i\u2004< \u200465\u00b0) from the S4G survey. We aim to link the loci of SF to global properties of the hosts (morphological type, stellar mass, gas fraction, and bar-induced gravitational torques), providing constraints for the conditions that regulate SF in bars.Methods.We use archival GALEX far- and near-UV imaging for 772 barred galaxies, and for a control sample of 423 non-barred galaxies. We also assemble a compilation of continuum-subtracted H\u03b1images for 433 barred galaxies, 70 of which we produced from ancillary photometry and MUSE and CALIFA integral field unit data cubes. We employ two complementary approaches: (i) the analysis of bar (2D) and disk (1D) stacks built from co-added UV images (oriented and scaled with respect to the stellar bars and the extent of disks) of hundreds of galaxies that are binned based on their Hubble stage (T) and bar family; and (ii) the visual classification of the morphology of ionized regions (traced from H\u03b1and UV data) in individual galaxies into three main SF classes: (A) only circumnuclear SF; (B) SF at the bar ends, but not along the bar; and (C) SF along the bar. Barred galaxies with active and passive inner rings are likewise classified.Results.Massive, gas-poor, lenticular galaxies typically belong to SF class A; this is probably related to bar-induced quenching of SF in the disk. The distribution of SF class B peaks for early- and intermediate-type spirals; this most likely results from the interplay of gas flow, shocks, and enhanced shear in massive centrally concentrated galaxies with large bar amplitudes (the latter is supported by the lack of a dip in the radial distribution of SF in non-barred galaxies). Late-type gas-rich galaxies with high gravitational torques are mainly assigned to SF class C; we argue that this is a consequence of low shear among the faintest galaxies. In bar stacks of spiral galaxies the UV emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as witnessed in simulations. Among early-type spirals the central UV emission is \u223c0.5 mag brighter in strongly barred galaxies, relative to their weakly barred counterparts; this is probably related to the efficiency of strong bars sweeping the disk gas and triggering central starbursts. On the contrary, in later types the UV emission is stronger at all radii in strongly barred galaxies than in weakly barred and non-barred ones. We also show that the distributions of SF in inner-ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred galaxies, including a UV and H\u03b1deficit in the middle part of the bar; this hints at the effect of resonance rings trapping gas that is no longer funneled inwards.Conclusions.Distinct distributions of SF within bars are reported in galaxies of different morphological types. Star-forming bars are most common among late-type gas-rich galaxies. Bars are important agents in the regulation of SF in disks.",
"Over the last few years, many studies have found an empirical relationship between the abundance of a star and its age. Here we estimate spectroscopic stellar ages for 178 825 red-giant stars observed by the APOGEE survey with a median statistical uncertainty of 17%. To this end, we use the supervised machine learning techniqueXGBoost, trained on a high-quality dataset of 3060 red-giant and red-clump stars with asteroseismic ages observed by both APOGEE andKepler. After verifying the obtained age estimates with independent catalogues, we investigate some of the classical chemical, positional, and kinematic relationships of the stars as a function of their age. We find a very clear imprint of the outer-disc flare in the age maps and confirm the recently found split in the local age-metallicity relation. We present new and precise measurements of the Galactic radial metallicity gradient in small age bins between 0.5 and 12 Gyr, confirming a steeper metallicity gradient for \u223c2\u2005\u2212\u20055 Gyr old populations and a subsequent flattening for older populations mostly produced by radial migration. In addition, we analyse the dispersion about the abundance gradient as a function of age. We find a clear power-law trend (with an exponent\u03b2\u2004\u2248\u20040.15) for this relation, indicating a relatively smooth radial migration history in the Galactic disc over the past 7\u2005\u2212\u20059 Gyr. Departures from this power law may possibly be related to the Gaia Enceladus merger and passages of the Sagittarius dSph galaxy. Finally, we confirm previous measurements showing a steepening in the age-velocity dispersion relation at around \u223c9 Gyr, but now extending it over a large extent of the Galactic disc (5 kpc <RGal\u2004<\u200413 kpc). To establish whether this steepening is the imprint of a Galactic merger event, however, detailed forward modelling work of our data is necessary. Our catalogue of precise stellar ages and the source code to create it are publicly available.",
"We combine the results of our earlier study of the UV characteristics of 18 classical novae (CNe) with data from the literature and with the recent precise distance determinations from the Gaia satellite to investigate the statistical properties of old novae. All final parameters for the sample include a detailed treatment of the errors and their propagation. The physical properties reported here include the absolute magnitudes at maximum and minimum, a new maximum magnitude versus rate of decline (MMRD) relation, and the inclination-corrected 1100\u20136000 \u00c5 accretion disk luminosity. Most importantly, these data have allowed us to derive a homogenous set of accretion rates in quiescence for the 18 novae. All novae in the sample were super-Eddington during outburst, with an average absolute magnitude at maximum of \u22127.5\u2005\u00b1\u20051.0. The average absolute magnitude at minimum corrected for inclination is 3.9\u2005\u00b1\u20051.0. The median mass accretion rate is log \u1e401 M\u2299 = \u22128.52 (using 1\u2006M\u2299 as WD mass for all novae) or log \u1e40MWD = \u22128.48 (using the individual WD masses). These values are lower than those assumed in studies of CNe evolution and appear to attenuate the need for a hibernation hypothesis to interpret the nova phenomenon. We identified a number of correlations among the physical parameters of the quiescent and eruptive phases, some already known but others new and even surprising. Several quantities correlate with the speed class t3 including, unexpectedly, the mass accretion rate (\u1e40). This rate correlates also with the absolute magnitude at minimum corrected for inclination, and with the outburst amplitude, providing new and simple ways to estimate \u1e40 through its functional dependence on (more) easily observed quantities. There is no correlation between \u1e40 and the orbital period.",

"Context. The global context of making numerous data produced by researchers available requires collecting and organising the data, assigning meaningful metadata, and presenting the data in a meaningful and homogeneous way.

As the BASECOL database, interconnected with the VAMDC e-infrastructure, uses the VAMDC standards, the collisional data can be extracted with tools using VAMDC standards and can be associated with spectroscopic data extracted from other VAMDC connected databases such as the Cologne database for molecular spectroscopy (CDMS), the jet propulsion laboratory molecular spectroscopy database (JPL), and the high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database (HITRAN).",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Compact groups of galaxies have posed a number of challenging questions. Intensive observational and theoretical studies are now providing answers to many of these and, at the same time, are revealing unexpected new clues about the nature and role of these systems. Most compact groups contain a high fraction of galaxies having morphological or kinematical peculiarities, nuclear radio and infrared emission, and starburst or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. They contain large quantities of diffuse gas and are dynamically dominated by dark matter. They most likely form as subsystems within looser associations and evolve by gravitational processes. Strong galaxy interactions result and merging is expected to lead to the ultimate demise of the group. Compact groups are surprisingly numerous and may play a significant role in galaxy evolution. ",
"A planetary atmosphere is the outer gas layer of a planet. Besides its scientific significance among the first and most accessible planetary layers observed from space, it is closely connected with planetary formation and evolution, surface and interior processes, and habitability of planets. Current theories of planetary atmospheres were primarily obtained through the studies of eight large planets, Pluto and three large moons (Io, Titan, and Triton) in the Solar System. Outside the Solar System, more than four thousand extrasolar planets (exoplanets) and two thousand brown dwarfs have been confirmed in our Galaxy, and their population is rapidly growing. The rich information from these exotic bodies offers a database to test, in a statistical sense, the fundamental theories of planetary climates. Here we review the current knowledge on atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs from recent observations and theories. This review highlights important regimes and statistical trends in an ensemble of atmospheres as an initial step towards fully characterizing diverse substellar atmospheres, that illustrates the underlying principles and critical problems. Insights are obtained through analysis of the dependence of atmospheric characteristics on basic planetary parameters. Dominant processes that influence atmospheric stability, energy transport, temperature, composition and flow pattern are discussed and elaborated with simple scaling laws.

We also examine the Hertzsprung progression in different stellar systems by using the shape of I-band light curves (Fourier parameters) and observables based on the difference in magnitude and in phase between the bump and the minimum in luminosity. The distribution of Cepheids in optical and in optical\u2013near infrared (NIR) color\u2013magnitude diagrams is investigated to constrain the topology of the instability strip. The use of Cepheids as tracers of young (CCs), intermediate (ACs) and old (TIICs) stellar populations are brought forward by the comparison between observations (MCs) and cluster isochrones covering a broad range in stellar ages and in chemical compositions. The different diagnostics adopted to estimate individual distances (period\u2013luminosity, period\u2013Wesenheit, period\u2013luminosity\u2013color relations) are reviewed together with pros and cons in the use of fundamental and overtones, optical and NIR photometric bands, and reddening free pseudo magnitudes (Wesenheit). We also discuss the use of CCs as stellar tracers and the radial gradients among the different groups of elements (iron, $$\\alpha $$\n\u03b1\n, neutron-capture) together with their age-dependence. Finally, we briefly outline the role that near-future space and ground-based facilities will play in the astrophysical and cosmological use of Cepheids.",
"Context. Open clusters provide unambiguous clues to understand the evolution of 7Li at the surface of low-mass stars and its possible correlation with stellar rotation, which is a challenge for both stellar hydrodynamics and Galactic chemical evolution.Aims. We aim to quantify the efficiency of the transport processes for both angular momentum and chemicals that are required to explain simultaneously the observed behaviour of surface 7Li (and 9Be) and rotation as well as the internal rotation profiles inferred from helio- and asteroseismology in F- and G-type main sequence stars.Methods. We apply the model for the transport of angular momentum and chemicals that we tailored in a previous work for solar-type stars to an extended range of initial masses and metallicities corresponding to F- an G-type stars in a sample of 20 Galactic open clusters. We evaluate its ability to explain the 7Li, 9Be, and rotation periods observations. This model includes atomic diffusion, rotation-induced processes (for which we tested different prescriptions for shear turbulence), penetrative convection with a rotational dependence, parametric viscosity and turbulence, and magnetic braking.Results. Over the entire range of masses, metallicities, and ages explored, we reproduce the evolution of the surface rotation rates and predict, for the first time, the observed anti-correlation between the surface rotation rate and 7Li depletion as a consequence of the penetrative convection prescription. The 7Li behaviour and its evolution with time is well reproduced for G-type stars. However, the ability of the model to reproduce the so-called 7Li dip centred around \u223c6600 K strongly depends on the adopted prescriptions for shear turbulence. It also requires a stellar mass dependence for the parametric viscosity adopted for the transport of angular momentum, similar to the behaviour predicted for the generation and luminosity of internal gravity waves generated by stellar convective envelopes. Finally, the model predicts internal rotation profiles in good agreement with asteroseismic constraints in main sequence stars.Conclusions. We provide an efficient way to model G-type stars of different ages and metallicities successfully. However, the 7Li and 9Be dip constraints urgently call for further hydrodynamical studies to better model turbulence in stars, and for the exploration of physical processes such as tachocline mixing for the transport of chemicals and internal gravity waves for the transport of angular momentum. Finally, additional data for the internal rotation and for 9Be in main sequence low-mass stars are definitively needed.",
"Ever deeper and wider look-back surveys have led to a fairly robust outline of the cosmic star-formation history, which culminated around [Formula: see text]; this period is often nicknamed \u201ccosmic noon.\u201d Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: \u25aa\u2002 Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to [Formula: see text], pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. \u25aa\u2002 Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at [Formula: see text] play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. \u25aa\u2002 Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at [Formula: see text] are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. \u25aa\u2002 Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGNs and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation.We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes.",
"Context. Previous studies have concluded that low- and intermediate-mass stars cannot account for the interstellar dust yield in the Magellanic Clouds inferred from far-infrared and sub-millimetre observations.Aims. Luminous blue variable stars (LBVs) form dust as a result of episodic, violent mass loss. To investigate their contribution as dust producers in the Magellanic Clouds, we analyse 31 confirmed and candidate LBVs from a recent census.Methods. We built a maximally complete multi-wavelength dataset of these sources from archival space telescope images and catalogues from near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. We also present new Very Large Telescope VISIR observations of three sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We review the LBV classification on the basis of the infrared spectral energy distribution. To derive characteristic dust parameters, we fitted the photometry resulting from a stacking analysis, which consists of co-adding images of the same wavelength band of several targets to improve the signal-to-noise. For comparison we also stacked the images of low- and intermediate-mass evolved stars in the LMC.Results. We find four classes of sources: (1) LBVs showing mid-infrared dust emission plus near-infrared free-free emission from an ionised stellar wind (Class 1a) or only mid-infrared dust emission (Class 1b); (2) LBVs with a near-infrared excess due to free-free emission only (Class 2); (3) objects with an sgB[e] classification in the literature, displaying a distinctive hot dust component; and (4) objects with no detected stellar winds and no circumstellar matter in their SEDs. From the stacking analysis of the 18 Class 1 and 2 objects in the LMC, we derived an integrated dust mass of 0.11\u22120.03+0.06\u2005M\u2299. This is two orders of magnitude larger than the value inferred from stacking 1342 extreme-asymptotic giant branch stars. The dust mass of individual LBVs does not correlate with the stellar parameters, possibly suggesting that the dust production mechanism is independent of the initial stellar mass or that the stars have different evolutionary histories. The total dust yield from LBVs over the age of the LMC is \u223c104\u2005\u2212\u2005105\u2006M\u2299. The one order of magnitude uncertainty is mainly due to uncertainties of the LBV population, star formation history, and initial mass function.Conclusions. LBVs are potentially the second most important source of dust in normal galaxies. The role of dust destruction in LBV nebulae by a possible subsequent supernova (SN) blast wave has yet to be determined. Recent theoretical developments in the field of dust processing by SN shocks highlight the potential survival of dust grains from the pre-existing circumstellar nebula.",
"Studies of galaxy clusters have proved crucial in helping to establish the standard model of cosmology, with a Universe dominated by dark matter and dark energy. A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.",
"The black hole mass function of supermassive black holes describes the evolution of the distribution of black hole mass. It is one of the primary empirical tools available for mapping the growth of supermassive black holes and for constraining theoretical models of their evolution. In this paper, we discuss methods for estimating the black hole mass function, including their advantages and disadvantages. We also review the results of using these methods for estimating the mass function of both active and inactive black holes. In addition, we review current theoretical models for the growth of supermassive black holes that predict the black hole mass function. We conclude with a discussion of directions for future research which will lead to improvement in both empirical and theoretical determinations of the mass function of supermassive black holes.",
"We introduce the SAPP (Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline), the prototype of the code that will be used to determine parameters of stars observed within the core program of the PLATO space mission. The pipeline is based on the Bayesian inference and provides effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, chemical abundances, and luminosity. The code in its more general version has a much wider range of potential applications. It can also provide masses, ages, and radii of stars and can be used with stellar types not targeted by the PLATO core program, such as red giants. We validate the code on a set of 27 benchmark stars that includes 19 FGK-type dwarfs, 6 GK-type subgiants, and 2 red giants. Our results suggest that combining various observables is the optimal approach, as this allows the degeneracies between different parameters to be broken and yields more accurate values of stellar parameters and more realistic uncertainties. For the PLATO core sample, we obtain a typical uncertainty of 27 (syst.) \u00b1 37 (stat.) K for Teff, 0.00\u2005\u00b1\u20050.01 dex for log g, 0.02\u2005\u00b1\u20050.02 dex for metallicity [Fe/H], \u22120.01\u2005\u00b1\u20050.03\u2006R\u2299 for radii, \u22120.01\u2005\u00b1\u20050.05\u2006M\u2299 for stellar masses, and \u22120.14\u2005\u00b1\u20050.63 Gyr for ages. We also show that the best results are obtained by combining the \u03bdmax scaling relation with stellar spectra. This resolves the notorious problem of degeneracies, which is particularly important for F-type stars.",
"The objective of this work is to study how active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence star formation in host galaxies. We present a detailed investigation of the star-formation history and conditions of a z\u2004=\u20042.57 massive radio galaxy based on VLT/X-shooter and ALMA observations. The deep rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum contains photospheric absorption lines and wind features indicating the presence of OB-type stars. The most significantly detected photospheric features are used to characterize the recent star formation: neither instantaneous nor continuous star-formation history is consistent with the relative strength of the Si\u202fII\u03bb1485 and S\u202fV\u03bb1502 absorption. Rather, at least two bursts of star formation took place in the recent past, at 6+1-2 Myr and \u227320 Myr ago, respectively. We deduce a molecular H2 gas mass of (3.9\u2005\u00b1\u20051.0)\u2005\u00d7\u20051010\u2006M\u2299 based on ALMA observations of the [C\u202fI] 3P2\u22123P1 emission. The molecular gas mass is only 13% of its stellar mass. Combined with its high star-formation rate of (1020-170+190 M\u2299 yr-1, this implies a high star-formation efficiency of (26\u2005\u00b1\u20058) Gyr\u22121 and a short depletion time of (38\u2005\u00b1\u200512) Myr. We attribute the efficient star formation to compressive gas motions in order to explain the modest velocity dispersions (\u2a7d55 km s\u22121) of the photospheric lines and of the star-forming gas traced by [C\u202fI]. Because of the likely very young age of the radio source, our findings suggest that vigorous star formation consumes much of the gas and works in concert with the AGN to remove any residual molecular gas, and eventually quenching star formation in massive galaxies.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Observational studies of low-mass stars during their early stages of evolution, from protostars through the zero-age main sequence, show highly elevated levels of magnetic activity. This activity includes strong fields covering much of the stellar surface and powerful magnetic reconnection flares seen in the X-ray and radio bands. The flaring may occur in the stellar magnetosphere, at the star-disk interface, or above the circumstellar disk. Ionization from the resulting high-energy radiation may have important effects on the astrophysics of the disk, such as promotion of accretion and coupling to outflows, and on the surrounding interstellar medium. The bombardment of solids in the solar nebula by flare shocks and energetic particles may account for various properties of meteorites, such as chondrule melting and spallogenic isotopes. X-ray surveys also improve our samples of young stars, particularly in the weak-lined T Tauri phase after disks have dissipated, with implications for our understanding of star formation in the solar neighborhood.",
"We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\u25aaCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\n                        b (the binary period) or \u223c5P\n                        b, depending on the binary eccentricity e\n                        b and mass ratio q\n                        b.\u25aaThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\u25aaOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\n                        b and q\n                        b) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\u25aaA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\n                        b is significant, the disk can evolve toward \u201cpolar alignment,\u201d with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n            ",
"Context. The observation of several L-band emission sources in the S cluster has led to a rich discussion of their nature. However, a definitive answer to the classification of the dusty objects requires an explanation for the detection of compact Doppler-shifted Br\u03b3 emission. The ionized hydrogen in combination with the observation of mid-infrared L-band continuum emission suggests that most of these sources are embedded in a dusty envelope. These embedded sources are part of the S-cluster, and their relationship to the S-stars is still under debate. To date, the question of the origin of these two populations has been vague, although all explanations favor migration processes for the individual cluster members.Aims. This work revisits the S-cluster and its dusty members orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A* on bound Keplerian orbits from a kinematic perspective. The aim is to explore the Keplerian parameters for patterns that might imply a nonrandom distribution of the sample. Additionally, various analytical aspects are considered to address the nature of the dusty sources.Methods. Based on the photometric analysis, we estimated the individual H\u2005\u2212\u2005K and K\u2005\u2212\u2005L colors for the source sample and compared the results to known cluster members. The classification revealed a noticeable contrast between the S-stars and the dusty sources. To fit the flux-density distribution, we utilized the radiative transfer code HYPERION and implemented a young stellar object Class I model. We obtained the position angle from the Keplerian fit results; additionally, we analyzed the distribution of the inclinations and the longitudes of the ascending node.Results. The colors of the dusty sources suggest a stellar nature consistent with the spectral energy distribution in the near and mid-infrared domains. Furthermore, the evaporation timescales of dusty and gaseous clumps in the vicinity of Sgr A* are much shorter (\u226a2 yr) than the epochs covered by the observations (\u224815 yr). In addition to the strong evidence for the stellar classification of the D-sources, we also find a clear disk-like pattern following the arrangements of S-stars proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we find a global intrinsic inclination for all dusty sources of 60\u2005\u00b1\u200520\u00b0, implying a common formation process.Conclusions. The pattern of the dusty sources manifested in the distribution of the position angles, inclinations, and longitudes of the ascending node strongly suggests two different scenarios: the main-sequence stars and the dusty stellar S-cluster sources share a common formation history or migrated with a similar formation channel in the vicinity of Sgr A*. Alternatively, the gravitational influence of Sgr A* in combination with a massive perturber, such as a putative intermediate mass black hole in the IRS 13 cluster, forces the dusty objects and S-stars to follow a particular orbital arrangement.",
"Context.Understanding the formation mechanisms of protoplanetary disks and multiple systems and also their pristine properties are key questions for modern astrophysics. The properties of the youngest disks, embedded in rotating infalling protostellar envelopes, have largely remained unconstrained up to now.Aims.We aim to observe the youngest protostars with a spatial resolution that is high enough to resolve and characterize the progenitors of protoplanetary disks. This can only be achieved using submillimeter and millimeter interferometric facilities. In the framework of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer survey CALYPSO, we have obtained subarcsecond observations of the dust continuum emission at 231 and 94 GHz for a sample of 16 solar-type Class 0 protostars.Methods.In an attempt to identify disk-like structures embedded at small scales in the protostellar envelopes, we modeled the dust continuum emission visibility profiles using Plummer-like envelope models and envelope models that include additional Gaussian disk-like components.Results.Our analysis shows that in the CALYPSO sample, 11 of the 16 Class 0 protostars are better reproduced by models including a disk-like dust continuum component contributing to the flux at small scales, but less than 25% of these candidate protostellar disks are resolved at radii >60 au. Including all available literature constraints on Class 0 disks at subarcsecond scales, we show that our results are representative: most (>72% in a sample of 26 protostars) Class 0 protostellar disks are small and emerge only at radii <60 au. We find a multiplicity fraction of the CALYPSO protostars \u227257% \u00b1 10% at the scales 100\u20135000 au, which generally agrees with the multiplicity properties of Class I protostars at similar scales.Conclusions.We compare our observational constraints on the disk size distribution in Class 0 protostars to the typical disk properties from protostellar formation models. If Class 0 protostars contain similar rotational energy as is currently estimated for prestellar cores, then hydrodynamical models of protostellar collapse systematically predict a high occurrence of large disks. Our observations suggest that these are rarely observed, however. Because they reduce the centrifugal radius and produce a disk size distribution that peaks at radii <100 au during the main accretion phase, magnetized models of rotating protostellar collapse are favored by our observations.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass (SNe IIn) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. ",
"I review the spatially resolved spectroscopic properties of low-redshift star-forming galaxies (and their retired counterparts) using results from the most recent optical integral field spectroscopy galaxy surveys. First, I briefly summarize the global spectroscopic properties of these galaxies, discussing the main ionization processes and the global relations described by the star-formation rates, gas-phase oxygen abundances, and average properties of their stellar populations (age and metallicity) in comparison with the stellar mass. Second, I present the local distribution of the ionizing processes down to kiloparsec scales, and I show how the global scaling relations found using integrated parameters (like the star-formation main sequence, mass\u2013metallicity relation, and Schmidt\u2013Kennicutt law) have local/resolved counterparts, with the global ones being, for the most part, just integrated/average versions of the local ones. I discuss the local/resolved star-formation histories (SFHs) and chemical-enrichment histories and their implications on the inside-out growth of galaxies. Third, I present the radial distributions of the surface densities of the properties explored globally and how they depend on the integrated galaxy properties.In conclusion, I find that the evolution of galaxies is mostly governed by local processes but clearly affected by global ones: \u25aa\u2002 Many global scaling relations present resolved counterparts (verified down to kiloparsec scales) that can explain them as well as the observed radial gradients in galaxies. \u25aa\u2002 These relations are consequences of the local SFHs, the narrow range of the depletion times, and a local metal enrichment. \u25aa\u2002 Deviations from these relations are due to dynamical and mixing processes, local exchange of gas (inflows, outflows, and fountains), depletion time differences, and/or differences in the resolved SFHs. \u25aa\u2002 Ionization happens at local scales that may be driven by different physical processes, and it cannot be clearly understood using purely integrated quantities. The dominant ionization in galaxies has a stellar origin.",
"Context. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are metal-poor with [Fe/H] < \u22121.0, displaying peculiar elemental abundances compared to solar values. The relative variations in the chemical compositions among stars is also increasing with decreasing stellar metallicity, allowing for the pure signature of unique nucleosynthesis processes to be revealed. The study of ther-process is, for instance, one of the main goals of stellar archaeology and metal-poor stars exhibit an unexpected complexity in the stellar production of ther-process elements in the early Galaxy.Aims. In this work, we report the atmospheric parameters, main dynamic properties, and the abundances of four metal-poor stars: HE 1523-0901, HD 6268, HD 121135, and HD 195636 (\u22121.5 > [Fe/H] > \u22123.0).Methods. The abundances were derived from spectra obtained with the HRS echelle spectrograph at the Southern African Large Telescope, using both local and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE and NLTE) approaches, with the average error between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.Results. Based on their kinematical properties, we show that HE 1523-0901 and HD 195636 are halo stars with typical high velocities. In particular, HD 121135 displays a peculiar kinematical behaviour, making it unclear whether it is a halo or an accreted star. Furthermore, HD 6268 is possibly a rare prototype of very metal-poor thick disk stars. The abundances derived for our stars are compared with theoretical stellar models and with other stars with similar metallicity values from the literature.Conclusions. HD 121135 is Al-poor and Sc-poor, compared to stars observed in the same metallicity range (\u22121.62 > [Fe/H] > \u22121.12). The most metal-poor stars in our sample, HE 1523-0901, HD 6268, and HD 195636, exhibit anomalies that are better explained by supernova models from fast-rotating stellar progenitors for elements up to the Fe group. Compared to other stars in the same metal-licity range, their common biggest anomaly is represented by the low Sc abundances. If we consider the elements beyond Zn, HE 1523-0901 can be classified as an r-II star, HD 6268 as an r-I candidate, and HD 195636 and HD 121135 exhibiting a borderliner-process enrichment between limited-r and r-I star. Significant relative differences are observed between the r-process signatures in these stars.",
"This work presents an in-depth analysis of four gravitationally lensed red galaxies at z = 1.6\u20133.2. The sources are magnified by factors of 2.7\u201330 by foreground clusters, enabling spectral and morphological measurements that are otherwise challenging. Our sample extends below the characteristic mass of the stellar mass function and is thus more representative of the quiescent galaxy population at z > 1 than previous spectroscopic studies. We analyze deep VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra and multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometry that cover the rest-frame UV-to-optical regime. The entire sample resembles stellar disks as inferred from lensing-reconstructed images. Through stellar population synthesis analysis, we infer that the targets are young (median age = 0.1\u20131.2 Gyr) and formed 80% of their stellar masses within 0.07\u20130.47 Gyr. Mg ii\n\u03bb\u03bb 2796, 2803 absorption is detected across the sample. Blueshifted absorption and/or redshifted emission of Mg ii are found in the two youngest sources, indicative of a galactic-scale outflow of warm (T \u223c 104 K) gas. The [O iii] \u03bb5007 luminosity is higher for the two young sources (median age less than 0.4 Gyr) than the two older ones, perhaps suggesting a decline in nuclear activity as quenching proceeds. Despite high-velocity (v \u2248 1500 km s\u22121) galactic-scale outflows seen in the most recently quenched galaxies, warm gas is still present to some extent long after quenching. Altogether, our results indicate that star formation quenching at high redshift must have been a rapid process (<1 Gyr) that does not synchronize with bulge formation or complete gas removal. Substantial bulge growth is required if they are to evolve into the metal-rich cores of present-day slow rotators.",
"Aims.We investigate the observed distribution of the joint primary mass, mass ratio, and redshift of astrophysical black holes using the gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration and included in the third gravitational wave transient catalogue.Methods.We reconstructed this distribution using Bayesian non-parametric methods, which are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions.Results.We find evidence that both the primary mass and mass-ratio distribution evolve with redshift: our analysis shows the presence of two distinct subpopulations in the primary mass\u2212redshift plane, with the lighter population, \u227220\u2006M\u2299, disappearing at higher redshifts,z\u2004>\u20040.4. The mass-ratio distribution shows no support for symmetric binaries.Conclusions.The observed population of coalescing binary black holes evolves with look-back time, suggesting a trend in metallicity with redshift and/or the presence of multiple redshift-dependent formation channels.",
"We show that measuring the velocity components of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) can discriminate between modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity. Hypervelocity stars are ejected from the Galactic center on radial trajectories with a null tangential velocity component in the reference frame of the Galaxy. They acquire tangential components due to the nonspherical components of the Galactic gravitational potential. Axisymmetric potentials only affect the latitudinal components, v\u03b8, and non-null azimuthal components, v\u03d5, originate from non-axisymmetric matter distributions. For HVSs with sufficiently high ejection speed, the azimuthal velocity components are proportionate to the deviation of the gravitational potential from axial symmetry. The ejection velocity threshold is \u223c750 km s\u22121 for 4 M\u2299 stars and increases with decreasing HVS mass. We determine the upper limit of v\u03d5 as a function of the galactocentric distance for these high-speed HVSs if MOND, in its quasi-linear formulation QUMOND, is the correct theory of gravity and either the triaxial Galactic bulge or a nonspherical hot gaseous halo is the primary source of the azimuthal component, v\u03d5. In Newtonian gravity, the HVSs within 60 kpc of the Galactic center may easily have v\u03d5 values higher than the QUMOND upper limit if the dark matter halo is triaxial or if the dark matter halo and the baryonic components are axisymmetric but their two axes of symmetry are misaligned. Therefore, even a limited sample of high-speed HVSs could in principle allow us to distinguish between the QUMOND scenario and the dark matter model. This test is currently limited by (i) the lack of a proper procedure to assess whether a star originates from the Galactic center and thus is indeed an HVS in the model one wishes to constrain; and (ii) the large uncertainties on the galactocentric azimuthal velocity components, which should be reduced by at least a factor of \u223c10 to make this test conclusive. A proper procedure to assess the HVS nature of the observed stars and astrometric measurements with microarcsecond precision would make this test feasible.",
"Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full distribution of stars from faint dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L\u22c6) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated \u201cgreen valley\u201d region of the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.",

The Li abundance observed in pre-main sequence and main sequence late-type stars is strongly age-dependent, but also shows a complex pattern depending on several parameters, such as rotation, chromospheric activity, and metallicity. The best way to calibrate these effects, and with the aim of studying Li as an age indicator for FGK stars, is to calibrate coeval groups of stars, such as open clusters (OCs) and associations.Aims. We present a considerable target sample of 42 OCs and associations \u2013 with an age range from 1 Myr to 5 Gyr \u2013 observed within the Gaia-ESO survey (GES), and using the latest data provided by GES iDR6 and the most recent release of Gaia that was then available, EDR3. As part of this study, we update and improve the membership analysis for all 20 OCs presented in our previous article.Methods. We perform detailed membership analyses for all target clusters to identify likely candidates, using all available parameters provided by GES, complemented with detailed bibliographical searches, and based on numerous criteria: from radial velocity distributions, to the astrometry (proper motions and parallaxes) and photometry provided by Gaia, to gravity indicators (log g and the \u03b3 index), [Fe/H] metallicity, and Li content in diagrams of (Li equivalent widths) EW(Li) versus Teff.Results. We obtain updated lists of cluster members for the whole target sample, as well as a selection of Li-rich giant contaminants obtained as an additional result of the membership process. Each selection of cluster candidates was thoroughly contrasted with numerous existing membership studies using data from Gaia to ensure the most robust results.Conclusions. These final cluster selections will be used in the third and last paper of this series, which reports the results of a comparative study characterising the observable Li dispersion in each cluster and analysing its dependence on several parameters, allowing us to calibrate a Li\u2013age relation and obtain a series of empirical Li envelopes for key ages in our sample.",
"Context. Radial velocity (RV) curves of Classical Cepheids allow precise determination of the resonant periods, which in turn help to constrain fundamental parameters of these stars. The RV curves of Cepheids are also useful for identifying their pulsation modes and for distance determination using the parallax-of-pulsation method.Aims. The primary goal of this paper is to derive precise Fourier parameters of the RV curves for fundamental and first-overtone Galactic Cepheids. Our secondary objectives are then to analyze the progression of the Fourier parameters up to the seventh harmonic, and to propose an identification of the pulsation modes of the stars.Methods. For each star, we carefully selected RV measurements available in the literature that yield the highest precision of Fourier parameters according to the procedure that follows. We performed a Fourier decomposition of the RV curves using the unweighted least-square method and the standard deviation of the fit was used to derive the uncertainty on the Fourier parameters. We corrected for zero-point differences between datasets and RV modulations caused by binary motion.Results. With this study we have more than doubled the number of Cepheids with published RV curve Fourier parameters and with their uncertainty properly estimated. Our sample includes 178 fundamental-mode and 33 first-overtone pulsators, as well as 7 additional Cepheids whose pulsation mode is uncertain or undetermined according to our criteria. For the fundamental-mode Cepheids, the precision of the obtained low-order Fourier phases and amplitudes is about seven times and 25% better, respectively, as compared to the precision achieved in previously published Fourier parameter surveys. With highly accurate RV Fourier phases \u03d521, we are able to firmly identify V495 Cyg as a new first-overtone Cepheid and we confirm the first-overtone nature of several other stars. In particular, \u03b1 UMi should be firmly classified as a first-overtone pulsator. In three objects (VY Per, AQ Pup, and QZ Nor), we find significant \u03b3-velocity variations, which for the first two objects (and possibly for QZ Nor as well) can be attributed to the spectroscopic binarity of these stars. Finally, the analysis of the fundamental mode Fourier parameters up to seventh order reveals tight progression of Fourier phases for all pulsation periods.Conclusions. We provide new precise Fourier parameters of Cepheid RV curves determined from RV measurements available in the literature together with unpublished data. The pulsation period coverage and the precision obtained, in particular for Fourier phase \u03d521, will be useful for studying the dynamics of Cepheid pulsations with the help of hydrodynamical models. Further RV measurements from modern high-resolution spectroscopic instruments will be important to improve these results.",
"Over the past decade, several works have used the ratio between total (rest 8\u22121000\u03bcm) infrared and radio (rest 1.4 GHz) luminosity in star-forming galaxies (qIR), often referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC), to calibrate the radio emission as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator. Previous studies constrained the evolution ofqIRwith redshift, finding a mild but significant decline that is yet to be understood. Here, for the first time, we calibrateqIRas a function ofbothstellar mass (M\u22c6) and redshift, starting from anM\u22c6-selected sample of > 400 000 star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV\u2005\u2212\u2005r)/(r\u2005\u2212\u2005J) colours, at redshifts of 0.1\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20044.5. Within each (M\u22c6,z) bin, we stacked the deepest available infrared/sub-mm and radio images. We fit the stacked IR spectral energy distributions with typical star-forming galaxy and IR-AGN templates. We then carefully removed the radio AGN candidates via a recursive approach. We find that the IRRC evolves primarily withM\u22c6, with more massive galaxies displaying a systematically lowerqIR. A secondary, weaker dependence on redshift is also observed. The best-fit analytical expression is the following:qIR(M\u22c6,\u2006z) = (2.646 \u00b1 0.024) \u00d7 (1\u2005+\u2005z)(\u2005\u2212\u20050.023\u2005\u00b1\u20050.008)\u2013(0.148 \u00b1 0.013) \u00d7 (log\u2006M\u22c6/M\u2299\u2005\u2212\u200510). Adding the UV dust-uncorrected contribution to the IR as a proxy for the total SFR would further steepen theqIRdependence onM\u22c6. We interpret the apparent redshift decline reported in previous works as due to low-M\u22c6galaxies being progressively under-represented at high redshift, as a consequence of binning only in redshift and using either infrared or radio-detected samples. The lower IR/radio ratios seen in more massive galaxies are well described by their higher observed SFR surface densities. Our findings highlight the fact that using radio-synchrotron emission as a proxy for SFR requires novelM\u22c6-dependent recipes that will enable us to convert detections from future ultra-deep radio surveys into accurate SFR measurements down to low-M\u22c6galaxies with low SFR.",
"We report the discovery, mass, and radius determination of TOI-1801 b, a temperate mini-Neptune around a young M dwarf. TOI-1801 b was observed in TESS sectors 22 and 49, and the alert that this was a TESS planet candidate with a period of 21.3 days went out in April 2020. However, ground-based follow-up observations, including seeing-limited photometry in and outside transit together with precise radial velocity (RV) measurements with CARMENES and HIRES revealed that the true period of the planet is 10.6 days. These observations also allowed us to retrieve a mass of 5.74 \u00b1 1.46M\u2295, which together with a radius of 2.08 \u00b1 0.12R\u2295, means that TOI-1801 b is most probably composed of water and rock, with an upper limit of 2% by mass of H2in its atmosphere. The stellar rotation period of 16 days is readily detectable in our RV time series and in the ground-based photometry. We derived a likely age of 600\u2013800 Myr for the parent star TOI-1801, which means that TOI-1801 b is the least massive young mini-Neptune with precise mass and radius determinations. Our results suggest that if TOI-1801 b had a larger atmosphere in the past, it must have been removed by some evolutionary mechanism on timescales shorter than 1 Gyr.",
"Context. The exoplanet sub-Neptune population currently poses a conundrum, as to whether small-size planets are volatile-rich cores without an atmosphere, or rocky cores surrounded by a H-He envelope. To test the different hypotheses from an observational point of view, a large sample of small-size planets with precise mass and radius measurements is the first necessary step. On top of that, much more information will likely be needed, including atmospheric characterisation and a demographic perspective on their bulk properties.Aims. We present here the concept and strategy of the THIRSTEE project, which aims to shed light on the composition of the sub-Neptune population across stellar types by increasing their number and improving the accuracy of bulk density measurements, as well as investigating their atmospheres and performing statistical, demographic analysis. We report the first results of the program, characterising a new two-planet system around the M-dwarf TOI-406.Methods. We analysed TESS and ground-based photometry together with high-precision ESPRESSO and NIRPS/HARPS radial velocities to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of the two planets orbiting TOI-406.Results. TOI-406 hosts two planets with radii and masses of Rc = 1.32 \u00b1 0.12 R\u2295, Mc = 2.08\u22120.22+0.23 M\u2295 and Rb = 2.08\u22120.15+0.16 R\u2295, Mb = 6.57\u22120.90+1.00 M\u2295, orbiting with periods of 3.3 and 13.2 days, respectively. The inner planet is consistent with an Earth-like composition, while the external one is compatible with multiple internal composition models, including volatile-rich planets without H/He atmospheres. The two planets are located in two distinct regions in the mass-density diagram, supporting the existence of a density gap among small exoplanets around M dwarfs. With an equilibrium temperature of only Teq = 368 K, TOI-406 b stands up as a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation with JWST in the low-temperature regime.",
"We present the results from multi-wavelength observations of a transient discovered during an intensive follow-up campaign of S191213g, a gravitational wave (GW) event reported by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration as a possible binary neutron star merger in a low latency search. This search yielded SN 2019wxt, a young transient in a galaxy whose sky position (in the 80% GW contour) and distance (\u223c150 Mpc) were plausibly compatible with the localisation uncertainty of the GW event. Initially, the transient\u2019s tightly constrained age, its relatively faint peak magnitude (Mi\u2004\u223c\u2004\u221216.7 mag), and ther-band decline rate of \u223c1 mag per 5 days appeared suggestive of a compact binary merger. However, SN 2019wxt spectroscopically resembled a type Ib supernova, and analysis of the optical-near-infrared evolution rapidly led to the conclusion that while it could not be associated with S191213g, it nevertheless represented an extreme outcome of stellar evolution. By modelling the light curve, we estimated an ejecta mass of only \u223c0.1\u2006M\u2299, with56Ni comprising \u223c20% of this. We were broadly able to reproduce its spectral evolution with a composition dominated by helium and oxygen, with trace amounts of calcium. We considered various progenitor channels that could give rise to the observed properties of SN 2019wxt and concluded that an ultra-stripped origin in a binary system is the most likely explanation. Disentangling genuine electromagnetic counterparts to GW events from transients such as SN 2019wxt soon after discovery is challenging: in a bid to characterise this level of contamination, we estimated the rate of events with a volumetric rate density comparable to that of SN 2019wxt and found that around one such event per week can occur within the typical GW localisation area of O4 alerts out to a luminosity distance of 500 Mpc, beyond which it would become fainter than the typical depth of current electromagnetic follow-up campaigns.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Radio astronomy has provided evidence for the presence of ionized atmospheres around almost all classes of nondegenerate stars. Magnetically confined coronae dominate in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Their radio emission is predominantly of nonthermal origin and has been identified as gyrosynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic electrons, apart from some coherent emission mechanisms. Ionized winds are found in hot stars and in red giants. They are detected through their thermal, optically thick radiation, but synchrotron emission has been found in many systems as well. The latter is emitted presumably by shock-accelerated electrons in weak magnetic fields in the outer wind regions. Radio emission is also frequently detected in pre\u2013main sequence stars and protostars and has recently been discovered in brown dwarfs. This review summarizes the radio view of the atmospheres of nondegenerate stars, focusing on energy release physics in cool coronal stars, wind phenomenology in hot stars and cool giants, and emission observed from young and forming stars.Eines habe ich in einem langen Leben gelernt, n\u00e4mlich, dass unsere ganze Wissenschaft, an den Dingen gemessen, von kindlicher Primitivit\u00e4t ist\u2014und doch ist es das K\u00f6stlichste, was wir haben.One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike\u2014and yet it is the most precious thing we have.\u2003\u2003\u2003A.

" A significant fraction of nearby galaxies show evidence of weak nuclear activity unrelated to normal stellar processes. Recent high-resolution, multiwavelength observations indicate that the bulk of this activity derives from black hole accretion with a wide range of accretion rates. The low accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and obscuring torus disappear in some of the faintest sources, and the optically thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk, and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although the existence of active nuclei in at least some late-type galaxies suggests that a classical bulge is not a prerequisite to seed a nuclear black hole.

"The hosts of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are predominantly starburst galaxies at subsolar metallicity. At redshifts z\u2004<\u20041, this implies that most of them are low-mass galaxies similar to the populations of blue compact dwarfs and dwarf irregulars. What triggers the massive star-formation needed for producing a GRB progenitor is still largely unknown, as are the resolved gas properties and kinematics of these galaxies and their formation history. Here we present a sample of six spatially resolved GRB hosts at z\u2004<\u20040.3 observed with 3D spectroscopy at high spectral resolution (R = 8000\u221213 000) using FLAMES/VLT. We analyzed the resolved gas kinematics of the full sample and the abundances in a subsample with strong enough emission lines. Only two galaxies show a regular disk-like rotation field, another two are dispersion-dominated, and the remaining ones have two narrow emission components associated with different parts of the galaxy but no regular rotation field, which might indicate a recent merger. All galaxies show evidence for broad components underlying the main emission peak with \u03c3 of 50\u2212110 km s\u22121. This broad component is more metal-rich than the narrow components, it is blueshifted in most cases, and it follows a different velocity structure. We find a weak correlation between the star-formation rate and the width of the broad component, its flux compared to the narrow component, and the maximum outflow velocity of the gas, but we do not find any correlation with the star-formation density, metallicity or stellar mass. We hence associate this broad component with a metal-rich outflow from star-forming regions in the host. The GRB is not located in the brightest region of the host, but is always associated with some star-forming region showing a clear wind component. Our study shows the great potential of 3D spectroscopy to study the star-formation processes and history in galaxies hosting extreme transients, the need for high signal-to-noise, and the perils using unresolved or only partially resolved data for these kinds of studies.",
"We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the \u039bCDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:\u25aaRealistic galaxies can be reproduced by calibrating the ill-constrained parameters of subgrid feedback models. Feedback is dominated by stars and black holes in low-mass and high-mass galaxies, respectively.\u25aaAdjusting or disabling the processes implemented in simulations can elucidate their impact on observables, but outcomes can be degenerate.\u25aaSimilar galaxy populations can emerge in simulations with dissimilar feedback implementations. However, these models generally predict markedly different gas flow rates into, and out of, galaxies and their halos. CGM observations are thus a promising means of breaking this degeneracy and guiding the development of new feedback models.",
"Context. The nature of the early generation of massive stars can be inferred by investigating the origin of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, likely formed from the ejecta of one or a few previous massive stars.Aims. We investigate the rotational properties of early massive stars by comparing the abundance patterns of EMP stars with massive stellar models including rotation.Methods. Low metallicity 20 M\u2299 massive stellar models with eight initial rotation rates between 0 and 70% of the critical velocity are computed. Explosions with strong fallback are assumed. The ejected material is considered to fit individually the abundance patterns of 272 EMP stars with \u22124\u2004< \u2004[Fe/H]\u2004< \u2004\u22123.Results. With increasing initial rotation, the [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H], and [Al/H] ratios in the massive star ejecta are gradually increased (up to \u223c4 dex) while the 12C/13C ratio is decreased. Among the 272 EMP stars considered, \u223c40\u2005\u2212\u200550% are consistent with our models. About 60\u2005\u2212\u200570% of the carbon-enhanced EMP star sample can be reproduced against \u223c20\u2005\u2212\u200530% for the carbon-normal EMP star sample. The abundance patterns of carbon-enhanced EMP stars are preferentially reproduced with a material coming from mid to fast rotating massive stars. The overall velocity distribution derived from the best massive star models increases from no rotation to fast rotation. The maximum is reached for massive stars having initial equatorial velocities of \u223c550\u2005\u2212\u2005640 km s\u22121.Conclusions. Although subject to significant uncertainties, these results suggest that the rotational mixing operating in between the H-burning shell and the He-burning core of early massive stars played an important role in the early chemical enrichment of the Universe. The comparison of the velocity distribution derived from the best massive star models with velocity distributions of nearby OB stars suggests that a greater number of massive fast rotators were present in the early Universe. This may have important consequences for reionization, the first supernovae, or integrated light from high redshift galaxies.",
"The physical mechanisms that link the termination of star formation in quiescent galaxies and the evolution of their baryonic components, stars, and the interstellar medium (ISM; dust, gas, and metals) are poorly constrained beyond the local Universe. In this work, we characterise the evolution of the dust content in 545 quiescent galaxies observed at 0.1\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20040.6 as part of the hCOSMOS spectroscopic redshift survey. This is, to date, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts for which the dust, stellar, and metal abundances are consistently estimated. We analyse how the crucial markers of a galaxy dust life cycle, such as specific dust mass (Mdust/M\u22c6), evolve with different physical parameters, namely gas-phase metallicity (Zgas), time since quenching (tquench), stellar mass (M\u22c6), and stellar population age. We find morphology to be an important factor in the large scatter in Mdust/M\u22c6 (\u223c2 orders of magnitude). Quiescent spirals exhibit strong evolutionary trends of specific dust mass with M\u22c6, stellar age, and galaxy size, in contrast to the little to no evolution experienced by ellipticals. When transitioning from solar to super-solar metallicities (8.7\u2004\u2272\u200412\u2005+\u2005log(O/H)\u22729.1), quiescent spirals undergo a reversal in Mdust/M\u22c6, indicative of a change in dust production efficiency. By modelling the star formation histories of our objects, we unveil a broad dynamical range of post-quenching timescales (60\u2006Myr\u2004<\u2004tquench\u2004<\u20043.2 Gyr). We show that Mdust/M\u22c6 is highest in recently quenched systems (tquench\u2004<\u2004500 Myr), but its further evolution is non-monotonic, as a consequence of different pathways for dust formation, growth, or removal on various timescales. Our data are best described by simulations that include dust growth in the ISM. While this process is prevalent in the majority of galaxies, for \u223c15% of objects we find evidence of additional dust content acquired externally, most likely via minor mergers. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that prolonged dust production on a timescale of 0.5\u2005\u2212\u20051 Gyr since quenching may be common in dusty quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts, even if their gas reservoirs are heavily exhausted (i.e. cold gas fraction < 1\u2005\u2212\u20055%).",
" Burst oscillations, a phenomenon observed in a significant fraction of Type I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts, involve the development of highly asymmetric brightness patches in the burning surface layers of accreting neutron stars. Intrinsically interesting as nuclear phenomena, they are also important as probes of dense matter physics and the strong gravity, high magnetic field environment of the neutron star surface. Burst oscillation frequency is also used to measure stellar spin, and doubles the sample of rapidly rotating (above 10 Hz) accreting neutron stars with known spins. Although the mechanism remains mysterious, burst oscillation models must take into account thermonuclear flame spread, nuclear processes, rapid rotation, and the dynamical role of the magnetic field. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of burst oscillations, an assessment of the status of the theoretical models that are being developed to explain them, and an overview of how they can be used to constrain neutron star properties such as spin, mass, and radius.

"We investigate the formation of red misfits (RM) using a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation from the eagle project. Similar to observations, the RM possess less dust, higher stellar metallicities, and older stellar populations compared to blue, star-forming galaxies (BA) at the same $M_\\star$. Lagrangian particle-tracking reveals that the older ages of RM have resulted from a combined effect of higher star formation efficiency (SFE), and the earlier onset and faster net depletion of their interstellar medium (ISM). For the centrals, the latter was partially due to higher efficiency of escape from ISM, driven by stronger stellar and/or active galactic nucleus feedback (depending on the mass). There was an additional contribution to this escape from gas stripping for satellite RM, as suggested by the higher group masses ($\\gtrsim 0.5$ dex) and $\\mathrm{H_2}/\\mathrm{H}\\, {\\rm{\\small I}}$ ratios ($\\gtrsim 0.3$ dex). Moreover, accretion of circumgalactic gas (CGM) on to the galaxy has been less efficient for the satellites. On the metallicity front, the offsets are largely due to the disparity in SFE, causing varying degrees of enrichment through the mass transfers associated with stellar winds and supernovae. We ascribe this SFE disparity to the lower specific angular momentum (j) of freshly accreted CGM for RM, which ultimately manifested in the ISM kinematics due to interactions with cooling flows. The impact on $j_{\\rm ism}$ was further intensified by poorer alignment with the flow\u2019s $\\vec{j}$, particularly for the satellites. Our results illuminate potential origins of RM, and motivate further exploration of this peculiar class through a synergy between observations and simulations.",
"All ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole (BH-BH) coalescences reported following the O1/O2 runs have near-zero effective spins. There are only three potential explanations for this. If the BH spin magnitudes are large, then: (i) either both BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin angular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in magnitude. Then there is also the possibility that (iii) the BH spin magnitudes are small. We consider the third hypothesis within the framework of the classical isolated binary evolution scenario of the BH-BH merger formation. We test three models of angular momentum transport in massive stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional currents (as employed in the Geneva code), an efficient transport by the Tayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (as implemented in the MESA code), and a very-efficient transport (as proposed by Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH spins. We allow for binary evolution to increase the BH spins through accretion and account for the potential spin-up of stars through tidal interactions. Additionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin BH masses, including revisions to the history of star formation and to the chemical evolution across cosmic time. We find that we can simultaneously match the observed BH-BH merger rate density and BH masses and BH-BH effective spins. Models with efficient angular momentum transport are favored. The updated stellar-mass weighted gas-phase metallicity evolution now used in our models appears to be key for obtaining an improved reproduction of the LIGO/Virgo merger rate estimate. Mass losses during the pair-instability pulsation supernova phase are likely to be overestimated if the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive than 50\u2006M\u2299. We also estimate rates of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers from recent LIGO/Virgo observations. If, in fact. angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient, then any (electromagnetic or gravitational wave) observation of a rapidly spinning BH would indicate either a very effective tidal spin up of the progenitor star (homogeneous evolution, high-mass X-ray binary formation through case A mass transfer, or a spin- up of a Wolf-Rayet star in a close binary by a close companion), significant mass accretion by the hole, or a BH formation through the merger of two or more BHs (in a dense stellar cluster).",
"Context. The frequency, semi-major axis, and mass distribution of stellar companions likely depend on the mass of the primaries and on the environment where the stars form. These properties are very different for early- and late-type stars. However, data are largely incomplete, even for the closest environments to the Sun, preventing a cleaner view of the problem.Aims. This paper provides basic information about the properties of companions to B stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus association (age \u223c 15 Myr); this is the closest association containing a large population of 181 B-stars.Methods. We gathered available data combining high contrast imaging samples from BEAST, SHINE, and previous surveys with evidence of companions from Gaia (both through direct detection and astrometry), from eclipsing binaries, and from spectroscopy. We evaluated the completeness of the binary search and estimated the mass and semi-major axis for all detected companions. These data provide a complete sample of stellar secondaries (extending well in the substellar regime) for separation> 3 au, and they are highly informative as to closer companions.Results. We found evidence for 200 companions around 181 stars. We did not find evidence for companions for only 43 (23.8\u2005\u00b1\u20053.6%) of the targets, with the fraction being as low as 15.2\u2005\u00b1\u20054.1% for stars with MA\u2004>\u20043.5 M\u2299 while it is 31.5\u2005\u00b1\u20055.9% for lower-mass stars. This confirms earlier findings for a clear trend of a binary fraction with stellar mass. The median semi-major axis of the orbits of the companions is smaller for B than in A stars, confirming a turn-over previously found for OB stars. The mass distribution of the very wide (a\u2004>\u20041000 au) and closer companions is different. Very few companions of massive stars MA\u2004>\u20045.0 M\u2299 have a mass below solar and even fewer are M stars with a semi-major axis < 1000 au. However, the scarcity of low-mass companions extends throughout the whole sample. Period and mass ratio distributions are different for early B stars (up to B7 spectral type) and stars of a later spectral type: most early B stars are in compact systems with massive secondaries, while less massive stars are mainly in wider systems with a larger spread in mass ratios. We derived log-normal fits to the distribution of the semi-major axis and mass ratios for low and high-mass B stars; these relations suggest that it is not probable that the planets and brown dwarf (BD) companions to b Cen and \u03bc2 Sco are extreme cases in the distribution of stellar companions.Conclusions. We interpret our results as the formation of secondaries with a semi-major axis < 1000 au (about 80% of the total) by fragmentation of the disk of the primary and selective mass accretion on the secondaries. The formation of secondaries within the disk of primaries in close binaries has been proposed by many others before; it unifies the scenarios for formation of close binaries with that of substellar companions that also form within the primary disk, though on a different timescale. We also find that the observed trends with primary mass may be explained by a more prolonged phase of accretion episodes on the disk and by a more effective inward migration. Finally, in the Appendices we describe the detection of twelve new stellar companions from the BEAST survey and of a new BD companion at 9.599 arcsec from HIP 74752 using Gaia data, and we discuss the cases of possible BD and low-mass stellar companions to HIP 59173, HIP 62058, and HIP 64053.",

Typical sensitivities for the full-resolution MGCLS image products range from \u223c3\u22125 \u03bcJy beam\u22121. The basic cubes are full-field and span 2\u00b0\u2005\u00d7\u20052\u00b0. The enhanced products consist of the inner 1.2\u00b0\u2005\u00d7\u20051.2\u00b0 field of view, corrected for the primary beam. The survey is fully sensitive to structures up to \u223c10\u2032 scales, and the wide bandwidth allows spectral and Faraday rotation mapping. Relatively narrow frequency channels (209 kHz) are also used to provide H\u202fImapping in windows of 0\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20040.09 and 0.19\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20040.48. In this paper, we provide an overview of the survey and the DR1 products, including caveats for usage. We present some initial results from the survey, both for their intrinsic scientific value and to highlight the capabilities for further exploration with these data. These include a primary-beam-corrected compact source catalogue of \u223c626 000 sources for the full survey and an optical and infrared cross-matched catalogue for compact sources in the primary-beam-corrected areas of Abell 209 and Abell S295. We examine dust unbiased star-formation rates as a function of cluster-centric radius in Abell 209, extending out to 3.5R200. We find no dependence of the star-formation rate on distance from the cluster centre, and we observe a small excess of the radio-to-100 \u03bcm flux ratio towards the centre of Abell 209 that may reflect a ram pressure enhancement in the denser environment. We detect diffuse cluster radio emission in 62 of the surveyed systems and present a catalogue of the 99 diffuse cluster emission structures, of which 56 are new. These include mini-halos, halos, relics, and other diffuse structures for which no suitable characterisation currently exists. We highlight some of the radio galaxies that challenge current paradigms, such as trident-shaped structures, jets that remain well collimated far beyond their bending radius, and filamentary features linked to radio galaxies that likely illuminate magnetic flux tubes in the intracluster medium. We also present early results from the H\u202fIanalysis of four clusters, which show a wide variety of H\u202fImass distributions that reflect both sensitivity and intrinsic cluster effects, and the serendipitous discovery of a group in the foreground of Abell 3365.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The Hubble space telescope observations of the northern Hubble deep field, and more recently its counterpart in the south, provide detections and photometry for stars and field galaxies to the faintest levels currently achievable, reaching magnitudes V \u223c 30. Since 1995, the northern Hubble deep field has been the focus of deep surveys at nearly all wavelengths. These observations have revealed many properties of high redshift galaxies and have contributed to important data on the stellar mass function in the Galactic halo.",
"Context. Consistent modeling of protoplanetary disks requires the simultaneous solution of both continuum and line radiative transfer, heating and cooling balance between dust and gas and, of course, chemistry. Such models depend on panchromatic observations that can provide a complete description of the physical and chemical properties and energy balance of protoplanetary systems. Along these lines, we present a homogeneous, panchromatic collection of data on a sample of 85 T Tauri and Herbig Ae objects for which data cover a range from X-rays to centimeter wavelengths. Datasets consist of photometric measurements, spectra, along with results from the data analysis such as line fluxes from atomic and molecular transitions. Additional properties resulting from modeling of the sources such as disk mass and shape parameters, dust size, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) properties are also provided for completeness.Aim. The purpose of this data collection is to provide a solid base that can enable consistent modeling of the properties of protoplanetary disks. To this end, we performed an unbiased collection of publicly available data that were combined to homogeneous datasets adopting consistent criteria. Targets were selected based on both their properties and the availability of data.Methods. Data from more than 50 different telescopes and facilities were retrieved and combined in homogeneous datasets directly from public data archives or after being extracted from more than 100 published articles. X-ray data for a subset of 56 sources represent an exception as they were reduced from scratch and are presented here for the first time.Results. Compiled datasets, along with a subset of continuum and emission-line models are stored in a dedicated database and distributed through a publicly accessible online system. All datasets contain metadata descriptors that allow us to track them back to their original resources. The graphical user interface of the online system allows the user to visually inspect individual objects but also compare between datasets and models. It also offers to the user the possibility to download any of the stored data and metadata for further processing.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Study of radio supernovae over the past 20 years includes two dozen detected objects and more than 100 upper limits. From this work it is possible to identify classes of radio properties, demonstrate conformance to and deviations from existing models, estimate the density and structure of the circumstellar material and, by inference, the evolution of the presupernova stellar wind, and reveal the last stages of stellar evolution before explosion. It is also possible to detect ionized hydrogen along the line of sight, to demonstrate binary properties of the stellar system, and to show clumpiness of the circumstellar material. More speculatively, it may be possible to provide distance estimates to radio supernovae.  Over the past four years the afterglow of gamma-ray bursters has occasionally been detected in the radio, as well in other wavelengths bands. In particular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst GRB980425, thought to be related to SN1998bw, is a possible link between supernovae and gamma-ray bursters. Analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable for SN1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well-established framework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. This allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties of the object. The radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a mildly relativistic (\u0393 \u223c 1.6) shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind\u2013established circumstellar medium that is highly structured both azimuthally, in clumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. Because of its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of SN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes of GRBs originate in massive star explosions. Thus, employing the formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae and following the link through SN1998bw/GRB980425, it is possible to model the gross properties of the radio and optical/infrared emission from the half-dozen GRBs with extensive radio observations. From this we conclude that at least some members of the \u201cslow-soft\u201d class of GRBs can be attributed to the explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured circumstellar medium that was presumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.

" The magnetic field is the main driver of the activity in the solar upper atmosphere, but its measurement is notoriously difficult. In order to determine the magnetic field in the chromosphere, transition region, and corona, we need to measure and interpret the polarization signals that the scattering of anisotropic radiation and the Hanle and Zeeman effects introduce in the emitted spectral line radiation. A number of recent advances have activated the development of this research field. \u25aa The quantum theory of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation allows us to explain the polarization signals observed in chromospheric and coronal lines and to make successful predictions in unexplored spectral regions. \u25aa The development of diagnostic techniques for the solar upper atmosphere has served to improve our empirical knowledge of the magnetic field in a variety of plasma structures, as well as to pave the way for their application to the unprecedented data that the new generation of solar telescopes are expected to provide. However, further improvements are required. \u25aa The CLASP suborbital experiments have opened a new diagnostic window, namely ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry as a tool for probing the magnetism and geometry of the upper chromosphere and transition region. A space telescope equipped with a UV spectropolarimeter would lead to major advances in our empirical understanding of solar magnetism. ",
"Context. Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an abundance of bright z\u2004>\u200410 galaxy candidates, challenging the predictions of most theoretical models at high redshifts.Aims. Since massive stars dominate the observable ultraviolet (UV) emission, we explore whether a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy towards higher redshifts and lower gas-phase metallicities results in a higher abundance of bright objects in the early universe and how it influences the evolution of galaxy properties compared to a constant Salpeter IMF.Methods. We parameterised the IMF based on the findings from hydrodynamical simulations that track the formation of stars in differently metal-enriched gas clouds in the presence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at different redshifts. We incorporated this evolving IMF into the ASTRAEUS (semi-numerical rAdiative tranSfer coupling of galaxy formaTion and Reionisation in N-body dArk mattEr simUlationS) framework, which couples galaxy evolution and reionisation in the first billion years. Our implementation accounts for the IMF dependence of supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and ionising and UV radiation emission. We conducted two simulations: one with a Salpeter IMF and the other with the evolving IMF. In both, we adjusted the free model parameters to reproduce key observables.Results. Compared to a constant Salpeter IMF, we find that (i) the higher abundance of massive stars in the evolving IMF results in more light per unit stellar mass, resulting in a slower build-up of the stellar mass and lower stellar-to-halo mass ratio; (ii) due to the self-similar growth of the underlying dark matter (DM) halos, the evolving IMF\u2019s star formation main sequence scarcely deviates from that of the Salpeter IMF; (iii) the evolving IMF\u2019s stellar mass to gas-phase metallicity relation shifts to higher metallicities, while its halo mass to gas-phase metallicity relation remains unchanged; (iv) the evolving IMF\u2019s median dust-to-metal mass ratio is lower due to its stronger SN feedback; and (v) the evolving IMF requires lower values of the escape fraction of ionising photons and exhibits a flatter median relation and smaller scatter between the ionising photons emerging from galaxies and the halo mass. However, the ionising emissivities of the galaxies mainly driving reionisation (Mh \u223c 1010 M\u2299) are comparable to those of a Salpeter IMF, resulting in minimal changes to the topology of the ionised regions.Conclusions. These results suggest that a top-heavier IMF alone is unlikely to explain the higher abundance of bright z\u2004>\u200410 sources, since the lower mass-to-light ratio driven by the greater abundance of massive stars is counteracted by stronger stellar feedback.",
"Context. Arp220 is the nearest and prototypical ultra-luminous infrared galaxy; it shows evidence of pc-scale molecular outflows in its nuclear regions and strongly perturbed ionised gas kinematics on kpc scales. It is therefore an ideal system for investigating outflow mechanisms and feedback phenomena in detail.Aims. We investigate the feedback effects on the Arp220 interstellar medium (ISM), deriving a detailed picture of the atomic gas in terms of physical and kinematic properties, with a spatial resolution that had never before been obtained (0.56\u2033, i.e. \u223c210 pc).Methods. We use optical integral-field spectroscopic observations from VLT/MUSE-AO to obtain spatially resolved stellar and gas kinematics, for both ionised ([N II]\u03bb6583) and neutral (Na ID\u03bb\u03bb5891,\u200696) components; we also derive dust attenuation, electron density, ionisation conditions, and hydrogen column density maps to characterise the ISM properties.Results. Arp220 kinematics reveal the presence of a disturbed kpc-scale disc in the innermost nuclear regions as well as highly perturbed multi-phase (neutral and ionised) gas along the minor axis of the disc, which we interpret as a galactic-scale outflow emerging from the Arp220 eastern nucleus. This outflow involves velocities up to \u223c1000 km s\u22121 at galactocentric distances of \u22485 kpc; it has a mass rate of \u223c50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and kinetic and momentum power of \u223c1043 erg s\u22121 and \u223c1035 dyne, respectively. The inferred energetics do not allow us to distinguish the origin of the outflows, namely whether they are active galactic nucleus- or starburst-driven. We also present evidence for enhanced star formation at the edges of \u2013 and within \u2013 the outflow, with a star-formation rate SFR \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (i.e. \u223c2% of the total SFR).Conclusions. Our findings suggest the presence of powerful winds in Arp220: They might be capable of heating or removing large amounts of gas from the host (\u201cnegative feedback\u201d) but could also be responsible for triggering star formation (\u201cpositive feedback\u201d).",
"Numerical models of photodissociation regions (PDRs) are an essential tool to quantitatively understand observations of massive star forming regions through simulations. Few mature PDR models are available and the Cologne KOSMA-\u03c4PDR model is the only sophisticated model that uses a spherical cloud geometry, thereby allowing us to simulate clumpy PDRs. We present the current status of the code as a reference for modelers and for observers that plan to apply KOSMA-\u03c4to interpret their data. For the numerical solution of the chemical problem, we present a superior Newton-Raphson stepping algorithm and discuss strategies to numerically stabilize the problem and speed up the iterations. The chemistry in KOSMA-\u03c4is upgraded to include the full surface chemistry in an up-to-date formulation and we discuss a novel computation of branching ratios in chemical desorption reactions. The high dust temperature in PDRs leads to a selective freeze-out of oxygen-bearing ice species due to their higher condensation temperatures and we study changes in the ice mantle structures depending on the PDR parameters, in particular the impinging ultraviolet field. Selective freeze-out can produce enhanced C abundances and higher gas temperatures, resulting in a fine-structure line emission of atomic carbon [Ci] enhanced by up to 50% if surface reactions are considered. We show how recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of HCO+emission in the Orion Bar with high spatial resolution on the scale of individual clumps can be interpreted in the context of nonstationary, clumpy PDR ensembles. Additionally, we introduce WL-PDR, a simple plane-parallel PDR model written in Mathematica to act as a numerical testing environment of PDR modeling aspects.",
"Context.Disc-halo decompositionsz\u2004=\u20041\u2005\u2212\u20052 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) atz\u2004>\u20041 are often limited to massive galaxies (M\u22c6\u2004>\u20041010M\u2299) and rely on either deep integral field spectroscopy data or stacking analyses.Aims.We present a study of the dark-matter (DM) content of ninez\u2004\u2248\u20041 SFGs selected among the brightest [O\u202fII] emitters in the deepest Multi-Unit Spectrograph Explorer (MUSE) field to date, namely the 140 h MUSE Extremely Deep Field. These SFGs have low stellar masses, ranging from 108.5to 1010.5\u2006M\u2299.Methods.We analyzed the kinematics with a 3D modeling approach, which allowed us to measure individual rotation curves to \u22483 times the half-light radiusRe. We performed disk-halo decompositions on their [O\u202fII] emission line with a 3D parametric model. The disk-halo decomposition includes a stellar, DM, gas, and occasionally a bulge component. The DM component primarily uses the generalized\u03b1,\u2006\u03b2,\u2006\u03b3profile or a Navarro-Frenk-White profile.Results.The disk stellar massesM\u22c6obtained from the [O\u202fII] disk-halo decomposition agree with the values inferred from the spectral energy distributions. While the rotation curves show diverse shapes, ranging from rising to declining at large radii, the DM fractions within the half-light radiusfDM(<Re) are found to be 60% to 95%, extending to lower masses (densities) recent results who found low DM fractions in SFGs withM\u22c6\u2004>\u20041010M\u2299. The DM halos show constant surface densities of \u223c100M\u2299pc\u22122. For isolated galaxies, half of the sample shows a strong preference for cored over cuspy DM profiles. The presence of DM cores appears to be related to galaxies with low stellar-to-halo mass ratio, logM\u22c6/Mvir\u2004\u2248\u2004\u22122.5. In addition, the cuspiness of the DM profiles is found to be a strong function of the recent star-formation activity.Conclusions.We measured the properties of DM halos on scales from 1 to 15 kpc, put constraints on thez\u2004>\u20040cvir\u2005\u2212\u2005Mvirscaling relation, and unveiled the cored nature of DM halos in somez\u2004\u2243\u20041 SFGs. These results support feedback-induced core formation in the cold dark matter context.",
"Context. The CARMENES instrument, installed at the 3.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory in Almer\u00eda, Spain, was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperate rocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. Moreover, the broad wavelength coverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to assess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral information to help characterise the stellar targets.Aims. We describe the CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO), spanning from 2016 to 2020, during which 19 633 spectra for a sample of 362 targets were collected. We present the CARMENES Data Release 1 (DR1), which makes public all observations obtained during the GTO of the CARMENES survey.Methods. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18 642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained.Results. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44 \u00b1 0.20 planets with 1 M\u2295 < Mpl sin i < 1000 M\u2295 and 1 day < Porb < 1000 days per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. All the DR1 raw data, pipeline-processed data, and high-level data products are publicly available online.Conclusions. CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions. They are also suitable for a variety of additional applications, such as the determination of stellar fundamental and atmospheric properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres.",
"Context. H2S is predicted to form by hydrogenation of atomic sulphur on grains and is thought to be the main sulphur reservoir in interstellar ice, being therefore a key molecule to understanding sulphur chemistry in the star formation process and to solving the missing sulphur problem in molecular clouds and star-forming regions. The study of the H2S deuterium fraction can be used to constrain its molecule formation pathways.Aims. The aim of this work is to investigate for the first time the deuteration of H2S in a large sample of starless cores.Methods. We used observations of the GEMS IRAM 30 m Large Program and complementary IRAM 30 m telescope observations. We considered a sample of 19 starless cores located in the Taurus, Perseus, and Orion molecular clouds, detecting HDS in ten of these starless cores, and D2S in five. The single and double H2S deuterium fractions were analysed with regard to their relation with the cloud physical parameters, comparisons with values obtained for other interstellar sources, and comparisons with deuterium fractions in early-stage star-forming sources of abundant molecules: c-C3H2, H2CS, H2O, H2CO, and CH3OH.Results. We obtain a range of X(HDS)/X(H2S) ~ 0.025\u20130.2 in the starless cores with HDS detections. The five starless cores with D2S detections show values of X(D2S)/X(HDS) ~ 0.05\u20130.3. H2S single deuteration shows an inverse relation with the cloud kinetic temperature, but no trend is found with molecular hydrogen density or visual extinction. H2S deuteration values in starless cores are similar to those observed in Class 0, although this may be a consequence of an observational bias due to the limited spatial resolution. Comparison with c-C3H2, H2CS, H2O, H2CO, and CH3OH in other interstellar sources reveals a general trend of decreasing deuteration with increasing temperature, with lower values for Class I and massive star-forming sources. In starless cores and Class 0 objects, H2CS and H2CO present higher deuteration fractions than c-C3H2, H2S, H2O, and CH3OH. H2O shows single and double deuteration values one order of magnitude lower than those of H2S and CH3OH.Conclusions. Differences between c-C3H2, H2CS and H2CO deuterium fractions and those of H2S, H2O, and CH3OH are related to deuteration processes produced in gas or solid phases, respectively. We interpret the differences between H2S and CH3OH deuterations and that of H2O as a consequence of differences in the formation routes in the solid phase, which can particularly be explained in terms of the different occurrence of the D-H and H-D substitution reactions in the ice, together with the chemical desorption processes. Further interferometric observations and laboratory experiments are needed to understand the deuteration processes.",
"We present the methodology for a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing from the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the partially overlapping Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS). Cross-correlations between BOSS and 2dFLenS galaxy positions and source galaxy ellipticities have been incorporated into the analysis, necessitating the development of a hybrid model of non-linear scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, and an assessment of signal contributions by astrophysical effects. All weak lensing signals were measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing. The calibration of photometric redshift distributions and multiplicative gravitational shear bias has been updated, and a more complete tally of residual calibration uncertainties was propagated into the likelihood. A dedicated suite of more than 20\u2006000 mocks was used to assess the performance of covariance models and to quantify the impact of survey geometry and spatial variations of survey depth on signals and their errors. The sampling distributions for the likelihood and the \u03c72 goodness-of-fit statistic have been validated, with proposed changes for calculating the effective number of degrees of freedom. The prior volume was explicitly mapped, and a more conservative, wide top-hat prior on the key structure growth parameter S8\u2004=\u2004\u03c38\u2006(\u03a9m/0.3)1/2 was introduced. The prevalent custom of reporting S8 weak lensing constraints via point estimates derived from its marginal posterior is highlighted to be easily misinterpreted as yielding systematically low values of S8, and an alternative estimator and associated credible interval are proposed. Known systematic effects pertaining to weak lensing modelling and inference are shown to bias S8 by no more than 0.1 standard deviations, with the caveat that no conclusive validation data exist for models of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, S8 constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29% for the joint analysis.",

We also discuss the theoretical implications of these statistical results for planet formation and dynamical evolution.",

"Context.Complex organic molecules are detected in many sources in the warm inner regions of envelopes surrounding deeply embedded protostars. Exactly how these species form remains an open question.Aims.This study aims to constrain the formation of complex organic molecules through comparisons of their abundances towards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293\u20132422.Methods.We utilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293\u20132422. The species identification and the rotational temperature and column density estimation were derived by fitting the extracted spectra towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 A and IRAS 16293\u20132422 B with synthetic spectra. The majority of the work in this paper pertains to the analysis of IRAS 16293\u20132422 A for a comparison with the results from the other binary component, which have already been published.Results.We detect 15 different complex species, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous companion protostar IRAS 16293\u20132422 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11 isotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first detections of methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH) and trans-ethyl methyl ether (t-C2H5OCH3) towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 B and the follow-up detection of deuterated isotopologues of acetaldehyde (CH2DCHO and CH3CDO). Twenty-four lines of doubly-deuterated methanol (CHD2OH) are also identified.Conclusions.The comparison between the two protostars of the binary system shows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are partially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is consistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher expected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the hot corino towards IRAS 16293\u20132422 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in IRAS 16293\u20132422 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In parallel, the list of identified CHD2OH lines shows the need of accurate spectroscopic data including their line strength.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 The information on the chemical compositions of stars encoded in their spectra plays a central role in contemporary astrophysics. Stellar element abundances are, however, not observed: to decipher the spectral fingerprints in terms of abundances requires realistic models for the stellar atmospheres and the line-formation processes. Still today, the vast majority of abundance analyses of late-type stars rely on one-dimensional (1D), hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In this review possible systematic errors in studies of F-, G- and K-type stars introduced by these questionable approximations are discussed. Departures from LTE are commonplace and often quite severe, in particular for low surface gravities or metallicities, with minority species and low-excitation transitions being the most vulnerable. Recently, time-dependent, 3D, hydrodynamical model atmospheres have started to be employed for stellar abundance purposes, with large differences compared with 1D modeling found in particular for metal-poor stars. An assessment of non-LTE and 3D effects for individual elements as well as on the estimated stellar parameters is presented. ",
"Products of stellar mergers are predicted to be common in stellar populations and can potentially explain stars with peculiar properties. When the merger occurs after the initially more massive star has evolved into the Hertzsprung gap, the merger product may remain in the blue part of the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram for millions of years. Such objects could, therefore, explain the overabundance of observed blue stars, such as blue supergiants. However, it is currently not straightforward to distinguish merger products from genuine single stars or other stars with similar surface diagnostics. In this work, we made detailed asteroseismic comparisons between models of massive post-main-sequence merger products and genuine single stars to identify which asteroseismic diagnostics can be used to distinguish them. In doing so, we developed tools for the relatively young field of merger seismology. Genuine single stars in the Hertzsprung gap are fully radiative, while merger products have a convective He-burning core and convective H-burning shell while occupying similar locations in the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram. These major structural differences are reflected in lower asymptotic period spacing values for merger products and the appearance of deep dips in their period spacing patterns. Our genuine single-star models with masses above roughly 11.4 solar masses develop short-lived intermediate convective zones during their Hertzsprung gap evolution. This also leads to deep dips in their period spacing patterns. Because of the lack of a convective core, merger products and genuine single stars can be distinguished based on their asymptotic period spacing value in this mass range. We performed the comparisons with and without the effects of slow rotation included in the pulsation equations and conclude that the two types of stars are seismically distinguishable in both cases. The observability of the distinguishing asteroseismic features of merger products can now be assessed and exploited in practice.",
" Observations show that at least some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) happen simultaneously with core-collapse supernovae (SNe), thus linking by a common thread nature's two grandest explosions. We review here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions (GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference. ",
"Context.Terrestrial extrasolar planets around low-mass stars are prime targets when searching for atmospheric biosignatures with current and near-future telescopes. The habitable-zone super-Earth LHS 1140 b could hold a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, and is an excellent candidate for detecting atmospheric features.Aims.In this study we investigate how the instellation and planetary parameters influence the atmospheric climate, chemistry, and spectral appearance of LHS 1140 b. We study the detectability of selected molecules, in particular potential biosignatures, with the upcomingJames WebbSpace Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).Methods.In the first step we used the coupled climate\u2013chemistry model 1D-TERRA to simulate a range of assumed atmospheric chemical compositions dominated by molecular hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, we varied the concentrations of methane (CH4) by several orders of magnitude. In the second step we calculated transmission spectra of the simulated atmospheres and compared them to recent transit observations. Finally, we determined the observation time required to detect spectral bands with low-resolution spectroscopy using JWST, and the cross-correlation technique using ELT.Results.In H2-dominated and CH4-rich atmospheres oxygen (O2) has strong chemical sinks, leading to low concentrations of O2and ozone (O3). The potential biosignatures ammonia (NH3), phosphine (PH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are less sensitive to the concentration of H2, CO2, and CH4in the atmosphere. In the simulated H2-dominated atmosphere the detection of these gases might be feasible within 20 to 100 observation hours with ELT or JWST when assuming weak extinction by hazes.Conclusions.If further observations of LHS 1140 b suggest a thin, clear, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, the planet would be one of the best known targets to detect biosignature gases in the atmosphere of a habitable-zone rocky exoplanet with upcoming telescopes.",
"We present the first study of the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of the gas in the entire southern Orion cloud complex. We used the parallaxes and proper motions of young stellar objects (YSOs) from Gaia DR2 as a proxy for gas distance and proper motion, and the gas radial velocities from archival CO data, to compute the space motions of the different star-forming clouds in the complex, including subregions in Orion A, Orion B, and two outlying cometary clouds. From the analysis of the clouds\u2019 orbits in space and time, we find that they were closest about 6 Myr ago and are moving radially away from roughly the same region in space. This coherent 100-pc scale radial motion supports a scenario where the entire complex is reacting to a major feedback event, which we name the Orion-BB (big blast) event. This event, which we tentatively associate with the recently discovered Orion X stellar population, shaped the distribution and kinematics of the gas we observe today, although it is unlikely to have been the sole major feedback event in the region. We argue that the dynamics of most of the YSOs carry the memory of the feedback-driven star formation history in Orion and that the majority of the young stars in this complex are a product of large-scale triggering, which can raise the star formation rate by at least an order of magnitude, as for the head of Orion A (the Integral Shape Filament). Our results imply that a feedback, compression, and triggering process lies at the genesis of the Orion Nebula Cluster and NGC 2023/2024 in Orion B, thus confirming broadly the classical feedback-driven scenario proposed in Elmegreen & Lada (1977, ApJ, 214, 725). The space motions of the well-known young compact clusters, \u03c3 Orionis and NGC 1977, are consistent with this scenario. A momentum estimate suggests that the energy of a few to several supernovae is needed to power the coherent 3D gas motion we measure in this paper.",
"Multiply imaged time-variable sources can be used to measure absolute distances as a function of redshifts and thus determine cosmological parameters, chiefly the Hubble Constant H$$_0$$\n\n\n0\n\n. In the two decades up to 2020, through a number of observational and conceptual breakthroughs, this so-called time-delay cosmography has reached a precision sufficient to be an important independent voice in the current \u201cHubble tension\u201d debate between early- and late-universe determinations of H$$_0$$\n\n\n0\n\n. The 2020s promise to deliver major advances in time-delay cosmography, owing to the large number of lenses to be discovered by new and upcoming surveys and the vastly improved capabilities for follow-up and analysis. In this review, after a brief summary of the foundations of the method and recent advances, we outline the opportunities for the decade and the challenges that will need to be overcome in order to meet the goal of the determination of H$$_0$$\n\n\n0\n\n from time-delay cosmography with 1% precision and accuracy.",
"Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) significantly contribute to the stellar buildup in galaxies during \u201ccosmic noon,\u201d the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs\u2019 prodigious star formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet/near-infrared (\u223c0.25\u20131.3 \u03bcm) emission in three DSFGs at z\u2004\u2243\u20042.5. Initially discovered as carbon monoxide (CO) emitters by NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of a bright (S350\u2006\u03bcm\u2004=\u2004111\u2005\u00b1\u200510 mJy) Herschel source, we observed them with the James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies\u2019 stellar populations and dust distributions on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based spectral energy distribution fitting. The CO emitters are massive (Mstar\u2004\u2243\u2004(3\u2005\u2212\u200530)\u00d71010 M\u2299), dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 M\u2299 yr\u22121, positioning them among the most active star-forming galaxies at 2\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20043. Notably, they belong to the \u223c1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk like (S\u00e9rsic index n\u2004\u2243\u20041), with effective radii of 2.0\u20134.4 kpc, and exhibit substructures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to AV = 5\u20137 mag extending over several kiloparsecs with asymmetric distributions that include off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. The near-infrared dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, possibly implying different dust\u2013star geometries or dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity (< 5\u2033) of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, an overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and widespread star formation collectively favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies\u2019 exceptional SFRs. The galaxies\u2019 large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.",
"We introduce the scientific motivations for the development of the Cassegrain U-Band Efficient Spectrograph (CUBES) that is now in construction for the Very Large Telescope. The assembled cases span a broad range of contemporary topics across Solar System, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, where observations are limited by the performance of current ground-based spectrographs shortwards of 400 nm. A brief background to each case is presented and specific technical requirements on the instrument design that flow-down from each case are identified. These were used as inputs to the CUBES design, that will provide a factor of ten gain in efficiency for astronomical spectroscopy over 300-405 nm, at resolving powers of $$R~\\sim$$\n\nR\n\n\u223c\n\n 24,000 and $$\\sim$$\n\u223c\n7,000. We include performance estimates that demonstrate the ability of CUBES to observe sources that are up to three magnitudes fainter than currently possible at ground-ultraviolet wavelengths, and we place its predicted performance in the context of existing facillities.",
"An exhaustive chemical characterization of dense cores is mandatory to our understanding of chemical composition changes from a starless to a protostellar stage. However, only a few sources have had their molecular composition characterized in detail. Here we present a \u03bb 3 mm line survey of L483, a dense core around a Class 0 protostar, which was observed with the IRAM 30 m telescope in the 80\u2013116 GHz frequency range. We detected 71 molecules (140 including different isotopologs), most of which are present in the cold and quiescent ambient cloud according to their narrow lines (FWHM ~ 0.5 km s\u22121) and low rotational temperatures (\u227210 K). Of particular interest among the detected molecules are the cis isomer of HCOOH, the complex organic molecules HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH, a wide variety of carbon chains, nitrogen oxides like N2O, and saturated molecules like CH3SH, in addition to eight new interstellar molecules (HCCO, HCS, HSC, NCCNH+, CNCN, NCO, H2NCO+, and NS+) whose detection has already been reported. In general, fractional molecular abundances in L483 are systematically lower than in TMC-1 (especially for carbon chains), tend to be higher than in L1544 and B1-b, and are similar to those in L1527. Apart from the overabundance of carbon chains in TMC-1, we find that L483 does not have a marked chemical differentiation with respect to starless/prestellar cores like TMC-1 and L1544, although it does chemically differentiate from Class 0 hot corino sources like IRAS 16293\u22122422. This fact suggests that the chemical composition of the ambient cloud of some Class 0 sources could be largely inherited from the dark cloud starless/prestellar phase. We explore the use of potential chemical evolutionary indicators, such as the HNCO/C3S, SO2/C2S, and CH3SH/C2S ratios, to trace the prestellar/protostellar transition. We also derived isotopic ratios for a variety of molecules, many of which show isotopic ratios close to the values for the local interstellar medium (remarkably all those involving 34S and 33S), while there are also several isotopic anomalies like an extreme depletion in 13C for one of the two isotopologs of c-C3H2, a drastic enrichment in 18O for SO and HNCO (SO being also largely enriched in 17O), and different abundances for the two 13C substituted species of C2H and the two 15N substituted species of N2H+. We report the first detection in space of some minor isotopologs like c-C3D. The exhaustive chemical characterization of L483 presented here, together with similar studies of other prestellar and protostellar sources, should allow us to identify the main factors that regulate the chemical composition of cores along the process of formation of low-mass protostars.",
"In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshifts, especially high-redshift GRBs, are a powerful tool for studying the structure and evolution of the early Universe. We review the background, the history, and the application of measurement methods of GRB redshifts in astronomy. Based on different observation targets, two measurement methods are mainly introduced. One is on GRB afterglow, the other is on GRB host galaxy. There are various processing methods belonging to measurement methods based on afterglow, including spectral measurement method of afterglow and afterglow spectral energy distribution fitting method with improved methods. There are also numerous measurement methods based on host galaxy, such as spectral measurement method of host galaxy, template matching method of host galaxy, some automatic spectroscopic redshift measurement methods, and machine learning methods. We subsequently introduce the principles, effects, and performance of these methods. We enumerate several detection and measurement instruments, which have been used in observation. The characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the GRB redshift measurement methods are summarized and analyzed. Furthermore, we provide a data set of 611 GRBs with measured redshift. The data set has been collected since 1997. Analysis and statistics are presented based on this data set. We summarize the characteristics of GRBs such as location, time, and accuracy. Finally, we introduce Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) mission dedicated to searching high redshift GRBs. We also introduce the application prospect of various redshift measurement methods in SVOM mission.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Far-ultraviolet radiation is a ubiquitous, if unanticipated, phenomenon in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges. It is the most variable photometric feature associated with old stellar populations. Recent observational and theoretical evidence shows that it is produced mainly by low-mass, small-envelope, helium-burning stars in extreme horizontal branch and subsequent phases of evolution. These are probably descendants of the dominant, metal rich population of the galaxies. Their lifetime UV outputs are remarkably sensitive to their physical properties and hence to the age and the helium and metal abundances of their parents. UV spectra are therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics of old stellar populations, although their calibration requires a much improved understanding of giant branch mass loss, helium enrichment, and atmospheric diffusion.

"Context. Young field stars are hardly distinguishable from older ones because their space motion rapidly mixes them with the stellar population of the Galactic plane. Nevertheless, a careful target selection allows for young stars to be spotted throughout the sky.Aims. We aim to identify additional sources associated with the four young comoving stars that we discovered towards the CO Cepheus void and to provide a comprehensive view of the Cepheus association.Methods. Based on multivariate analysis methods, we have built an extended sample of 193 young star candidates, which are the optical and infrared counterparts of ROSAT All-Sky Survey and XMM-Newton X-ray sources. From optical spectroscopic observations, we measured their radial velocity with the cross-correlation technique. We derived their atmospheric parameters and projected rotational velocity with the code ROTFIT. We applied the subtraction of inactive templates to measure the lithium equivalent width, from which we infer their lithium abundance and age. Finally, we studied their kinematics using the second Gaia data release.Results. Our sample is mainly composed of young or active stars and multiple systems. We identify two distinct populations of young stars that are spatially and kinematically separated. Those with an age between 100 and 300 Myr are mostly projected towards the Galactic plane. In contrast, 23 of the 37 sources younger than 30 Myr are located in the CO Cepheus void, and 21 of them belong to the stellar kinematic group that we previously reported in this sky area. We report a total of 32 bona fide members and nine candidates for this nearby (distance = 157\u2005\u00b1\u200510 pc) young (age = 10\u201320 Myr) stellar association. According to the spatial distribution of its members, the original cluster is already dispersed and partially mixed with the local population of the Galactic plane.",
"The metastable helium triplet in the near-infrared (10 833 \u00c5) is among the most important probes of exoplanet atmospheres. It can trace their extended outer layers and constrain mass loss. We used the near-infrared high-resolution spectropolarimeter SPIRou on the CFHT to search for the spectrally resolved helium triplet in the atmospheres of eleven exoplanets, ranging from warm mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters and orbiting G, K, and M dwarfs. Observations were obtained as part of the SPIRou Legacy Survey and complementary open-time programs. We applied a homogeneous data reduction to all datasets and set constraints on the presence of metastable helium, despite the presence of systematics in the data. We confirm published detections for HAT-P-11 b, HD 189733 b, and WASP-69 b and set upper limits for the other planets. We applied the p\u2013winds open source code to set upper limits on the mass-loss rate for the nondetections and to constrain the thermosphere temperature, mass-loss rate, line-of-sight velocity, and the altitude of the thermosphere for the detections. We confirm that the presence of metastable helium correlates with the stellar mass and the extreme-ultraviolet flux received by the planets. We investigated the correlation between the mass-loss rate and the presence of metastable helium, but it remains difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Finally, some of our results are in contradiction with previous results in the literature, and therefore we stress the importance of repeatable, homogeneous, and larger-scale analyses of the helium triplet to obtain robust statistics, study temporal variability, and better understand how the helium triplet can be used to explore the evolution of exoplanets.",
"Context.Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to be responsible for the suppression of star formation in massive \u223c1010\u2006M\u2299galaxies. While this process is a key feature in numerical simulations of galaxy formation, it has not been unambiguously confirmed in observational studies yet.Aims.The characterization of the star formation rate (SFR) in AGN host galaxies is challenging as AGN light contaminates most SFR tracers. Furthermore, the various SFR tracers are sensitive to different timescales of star formation from approximately a few to 100 Myr. We aim to obtain and compare SFR estimates from different tracers for AGN host galaxies in the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) to provide new observational insights into the recent SFR history of those systems.Methods.We constructed integrated panchromatic spectral energy distributions to measure the far infrared (FIR) luminosity as a tracer for the recent (< 100 Myr) SFR. In addition we used the integral-field unit observation of the CARS targets to employ the H\u03b1luminosity decontaminated by AGN excitation as a proxy for the current (< 5 Myr) SFR.Results.We find that significant differences in specific SFR of the AGN host galaxies as compared with the larger galaxy population disappear once cold gas mass, in addition to stellar mass, is used to predict the SFR for a specific AGN host. Only a tentative trend with the inclination of the host galaxy remains, such that SFR appears slightly lower than expected when the galaxies of unobscured AGN appear more edge-on along our line-of-sight, particular for dust-insensitive FIR-based SFRs. We identify individual galaxies with a significant difference in their SFR which can be related to a recent enhancement or decline in their SFR history that might be related to various processes including interactions, gas consumption, outflows, and AGN feedback.Conclusions.AGN can be present in various stages of galaxy evolution which makes it difficult to relate the SFR solely to the impact of the AGN. Our study shows that stellar mass alone is an insufficient parameter to estimate the expected SFR of an AGN host galaxy compared to the underlying non-AGN galaxy population. We do not find any strong evidence for a global positive or negative AGN feedback in the CARS sample. However, there is tentative evidence that (1) the relative orientation of the AGN engine with respect to the host galaxies might alter the efficiency of AGN feedback and that (2) the recent SFH is an additional tool to identify rapid changes in galaxy growth driven by the AGN or other processes.",
"Context.Blazars are the rarest and most powerful active galactic nuclei. They play a crucial and expanding role in the multifrequency and multimessenger astrophysics of today. Dominating the high-energy extragalactic sky, they have been recently associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and they may be among the accelerators of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Current blazar catalogs, however, are incomplete and they are depleted, in particular, at low Galactic latitudes.Aims.Our study is aimed at augmenting the current blazar census, starting from a sample of ALMA calibrators that provides more homogeneous sky coverage, especially at low Galactic latitudes, to build a catalog of blazar candidates that can provide candidate counterparts to unassociated\u03b3-ray sources and sources of high-energy neutrino emission or ultra-high energy cosmic rays.Methods.Based on the ALMA Calibrator Catalog, we compiled a selection of 1580 ALMA Blazar Candidates (ABCs) for which we collected multiwavelength information, includingGaiaphotometric, parallax, and proper motion data, as well as SDSS and LAMOST photometric and spectral data, WISE photometric data, X-ray (Swift-XRT,Chandra-ACIS andXMM-Newton-EPIC) count-rates and spectra, andFermi-LAT fluxes and spectral slopes. We also compared our ALMA Blazar Candidates with existing blazar catalogs, such as 4FGL, 3HSP, WIBRaLS2, and the KDEBLLACS.Results.The ABC catalog fills in the gaps with regard to low Galactic latitude sources in current blazar catalogs. By cross-matching this catalog withGaiaDR2, SDSS DR12, LAMOST DR5, AllWISE, and 4FGL catalogs, we obtained 805, 295, 31, 1311, and 259 matches, respectively. ALMA Blazar Candidates are significantly dimmer than known blazars in theGaiagband, while the difference in theGaiab\u2005\u2212\u2005rcolor between the two populations is less pronounced. Also, ABC sources appear bluer in SDSS than known blazars, although with low statistical significance. Most ABCs classified as QSO and BL Lac fall into the SDSS color regions of low redshift quasars, with some QSOs entering the regions of higher redshift quasars. We collected 110 optical spectra in SDSS DR12 and LAMOST DR5, which mostly classify the corresponding sources as QSO (98), while 12 sources turned out to be galactic objects. Regarding the WISE colors, we found that ABC sources are significantly bluer than known blazars in thew2\u2005\u2212\u2005w3 andw3\u2005\u2212\u2005w4 colors. In X-ray, we detected 173 ABCs and we were able to extract X-ray spectra for 92 of them. Our sources are, on average, similar in the X-ray band to known blazars in terms of count rates and spectral slopes, implying that our sample covers the same region of the blazar parameter space in this band. A comparison of\u03b3-ray properties shows that the ABCs are, on average, dimmer and that their\u03b3-ray spectra are softer than known blazars, indicating a significant contribution on the part of FSRQ sources. Making use of WISE colors, we classified 715 ABCs as candidate\u03b3-ray blazar of different classes.Conclusions.We built a new catalog of 1580 candidate blazars with a rich multiwavelength data-set, filling in the gaps for low Galactic latitude sources in current blazar catalogs. This will be particularly important for the identification of the source population of high-energy neutrinos or ultra-high energy cosmic rays, or to verify theGaiaoptical reference frame. In addition, ALMA Blazar Candidates can be investigated both through optical spectroscopic observation campaigns or through repeated photometric observations for variability studies. In this context, the data collected by the upcoming LSST surveys will provide a key tool for investigating the possible blazar nature of these sources.",
"In this paper, we first provide a brief review of the effective dynamics of two recently well-studied models of modified loop quantum cosmologies (mLQCs), which arise from different regularizations of the Hamiltonian constraint and show the robustness of a generic resolution of the big bang singularity, replaced by a quantum bounce due to non-perturbative Planck scale effects. As in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), in these modified models the slow-roll inflation happens generically. We consider the cosmological perturbations following the dressed and hybrid approaches and clarify some subtle issues regarding the ambiguity of the extension of the effective potential of the scalar perturbations across the quantum bounce, and the choice of initial conditions. Both of the modified regularizations yield primordial power spectra that are consistent with current observations for the Starobinsky potential within the framework of either the dressed or the hybrid approach. But differences in primordial power spectra are identified among the mLQCs and LQC. In addition, for mLQC-I, striking differences arise between the dressed and hybrid approaches in the infrared and oscillatory regimes. While the differences between the two modified models can be attributed to differences in the Planck scale physics, the permissible choices of the initial conditions and the differences between the two perturbation approaches have been reported for the first time. All these differences, due to either the different regularizations or the different perturbation approaches in principle can be observed in terms of non-Gaussianities.",
"Context. Hierarchical triple stars are ideal laboratories for studying the interplay between orbital dynamics and stellar evolution. Both mass loss from stellar winds and strong gravitational perturbations between the inner and outer orbit cooperate to destabilise triple systems.Aims. Our current understanding of the evolution of unstable triple systems is mainly built upon results from extensive binary-single scattering experiments. However, destabilised hierarchical triples cover a different region of phase space. Therefore, we aim to construct a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary pathways of destabilised triple-star systems.Methods. Starting from generic initial conditions, we evolved an extensive set of hierarchical triples using the code TRES, combining secular dynamics and stellar evolution. We detected those triples that destabilise due to stellar winds and/or gravitational perturbations. Their evolution was continued with a direct N-body integrator coupled to stellar evolution.Results. The majority of triples (54\u201369%) preserve their hierarchy throughout their evolution, which is in contradiction with the commonly adopted picture that unstable triples always experience a chaotic, democratic resonant interaction. The duration of the unstable phase was found to be longer than expected (103\u2005\u2212\u20054 crossing times, reaching up to millions), so that long-term stellar evolution effects cannot be neglected. The most probable outcome is dissolution of the triple into a single star and binary (42\u201345%). This occurs through the commonly known democratic channel, during which the initial hierarchy is lost and the lightest body usually escapes, but also through a hierarchical channel, during which the tertiary is ejected in a slingshot, independent of its mass. Collisions are common (13\u201324% of destabilised triples), and they mostly involve the two original inner binary components still on the main sequence (77\u201394%). This contradicts the idea that collisions with a giant during democratic encounters dominate (only 5\u201312%). Together with collisions in stable triples, we find that triple evolution is the dominant mechanism for stellar collisions in the Milky Way. Lastly, our simulations produce runaway and walk-away stars with speeds up to several tens of km/s, with a maximum of a few 100 km s\u22121. We suggest that destabilised triples can explain \u2013 or at least alleviate the tension behind \u2013 the origin of the observed (massive) runaway stars.Conclusions. A promising indicator for distinguishing triples that will follow the democratic or hierarchical route, is the relative inclination between the inner and outer orbits. Its influence can be summed up in two rules of thumb: (1) prograde triples tend to evolve towards hierarchical collisions and ejections, and (2) retrograde triples tend to evolve towards democratic encounters and a loss of initial hierarchy, unless the system is compact, which experience collision preferentially. The trends found in this work complement those found previously from binary-single scattering experiments, and together they will help to generalise and improve our understanding on the evolution of unstable triple systems of various origins.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Broad emission lines hold fundamental clues about the kinematics and structure of the central regions in AGN. In this article we review the most robust line profile properties and correlations emerging from the best data available. We identify fundamental differences between the profiles of radio-quiet and radio-loud sources as well as differences between the high- and low-ionization lines, especially in the radio-quiet majority of AGN. An Eigenvector 1 correlation space involving FWHM H\u03b2, W(FeIIopt)/W(H\u03b2), and the soft X-ray spectral index provides optimal discrimination between all principal AGN types (from narrow-line Seyfert 1 to radio galaxies). Both optical and radio continuum luminosities appear to be uncorrelated with the E1 parameters. We identify two populations of radio-quiet AGN: Population A sources (with FWHM(H\u03b2) [Formula: see text] 4000 km s\u22121, generally strong FeII emission and a soft X-ray excess) show almost no parameter space overlap with radio-loud sources. Population B shows optical properties largely indistinguishable from radio-loud sources, including usually weak FeII emission, FWHM(H\u03b2) [Formula: see text] 4000 km s\u22121and lack of a soft X-ray excess. There is growing evidence that a fundamental parameter underlying Eigenvector 1 may be the luminosity-to-mass ratio of the active nucleus (L/M), with source orientation playing a concomitant role.",
"Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs\u201460 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR\u00a01935 + 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.",
"Context.Planetary formation and evolution is a combination of multiple interlinked processes. Constraining the mechanisms observationally requires statistical comparison to a large diversity of planetary systems.Aims.We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes (accretion, migration, and interactions) and initial properties (like disc masses and metallicities) on the demographics of the planetary population. We also want to study the convergence of our scheme with respect to one initial condition, the initial number of planetary embryo in each disc.Methods.We selected distributions of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs. Then, we used the Generation III Bern model to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population consisting of 1000 stars (systems) that was used for an extensive statistical analysis of planetary systems around 1M\u2299stars.Results.The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at least ten embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains, on average, eight planets more massive than 1M\u2295. The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18%, but only 1.6% are at >10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. The planetary mass function varies asM\u22122between 5 and 50M\u2295. Both at lower and higher masses, it follows approximatelyM\u22121. The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of \u22120.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the 5\u201350M\u2295range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. To assess the impact of parameters and model assumptions, we also study two non-nominal populations: insitu formation without gas-driven migration, and a different initial planetesimal surface density.Conclusions.We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provides a large data set to search for comparison synthetic planetary systems that show how these systems have come into existence. The systems, including their full formation and evolution tracks are available online. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is an important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Astrobiology is the study of the living universe. Astronomy provides the context for the origin and evolution of life on Earth. Conversely, discoveries about the terrestrial biosphere\u2014from extremophilic microbes to the evolution of intelligence\u2014inform our thinking about prospects for life elsewhere. Astrobiology includes the search for extraterrestrial life via in situ exploration, spectroscopy of solar and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This review situates astrobiology within philosophical issues of the definition of life and the biological compatibility of the universe. It reviews the habitability of the Galaxy in general and of planets and moons in particular, and summarizes current controversies in origins-of-life research and in evidence for the earliest life on Earth. It critiques certain \u201crare Earth\u201d and \u201canthropic\u201d arguments, and considers four approaches to deciding whether intelligent life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. It concludes that astrobiology must also speak to the future of human civilization.",

"Massive star feedback affects the evolution of galaxies, where the most massive stars may have the largest impact. The majority of massive stars are born as members of close binary systems. In this work, we investigated detailed evolutionary models of very massive binaries (30\u221290 M\u2299) with Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity. We identify four effects defying the conventional knowledge of binary evolution, which are all related to the proximity of the models to the Eddington limit. We find that the majority of systems undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning. During the ensuing nuclear timescale evolution, many mass donors remain more massive than their companions (\u2018reverse Algols\u2019), and nuclear timescale mass transfer may be interrupted or absent altogether. Furthermore, due to the elevated luminosity-to-mass ratio, many of the core-hydrogen-burning donors may develop Wolf-Rayet-type winds at luminosities where single stars would not. We identify observational counterparts of very massive reverse Algol binaries in the LMC and discuss their contribution to the observed hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. We argue that understanding very massive Algol systems is key to predicting the advanced evolution of very massive binaries, including their ability to evolve into observable gravitational wave sources.",
"In the last decade, theKeplerand CoRoT space-photometry missions have demonstrated the potential of asteroseismology as a novel, versatile and powerful tool to perform exquisite tests of stellar physics, and to enable precise and accurate characterisations of stellar properties, with impact on both exoplanetary and Galactic astrophysics. Based on our improved understanding of the strengths and limitations of such a tool, we argue for a new small/medium space mission dedicated to gathering high-precision, high-cadence, long photometric series in dense stellar fields. Such a mission will lead to breakthroughs in stellar astrophysics, especially in the metal poor regime, will elucidate the evolution and formation of open and globular clusters, and aid our understanding of the assembly history and chemodynamics of the Milky Way\u2019s bulge and a few nearby dwarf galaxies.",
"Exploiting the sensitivity of the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and its ability to process large instantaneous bandwidths, we have studied the morphology and other properties of the molecular gas and dust in the star forming galaxy, H-ATLAS J131611.5+281219 (HerBS-89a), at z = 2.95. High angular resolution (0.\u20333) images reveal a partial 1.\u20330 diameter Einstein ring in the dust continuum emission and the molecular emission lines of 12CO(9\u22128) and H2O(202\u2005\u2212\u2005111). Together with lower angular resolution (0.\u20336) images, we report the detection of a series of molecular lines including the three fundamental transitions of the molecular ion OH+, namely (11\u2005\u2212\u200501), (12\u2005\u2212\u200501), and (10\u2005\u2212\u200501), seen in absorption; the molecular ion CH+(1\u2005\u2212\u20050) seen in absorption, and tentatively in emission; two transitions of amidogen (NH2), namely (202\u2005\u2212\u2005111) and (220\u2005\u2212\u2005211) seen in emission; and HCN(11\u2005\u2212\u200510) and/or NH(12\u2005\u2212\u200501) seen in absorption. The NOEMA data are complemented with Very Large Array data tracing the 12CO(1\u2005\u2212\u20050) emission line, which provides a measurement of the total mass of molecular gas and an anchor for a CO excitation analysis. In addition, we present Hubble Space Telescope imaging that reveals the foreground lensing galaxy in the near-infrared (1.15\u2006\u03bcm). Together with photometric data from the Gran Telescopio Canarias, we derive a photometric redshift of zphot = 0.9\u22120.5+0.3 for the foreground lensing galaxy. Modeling the lensing of HerBS-89a, we reconstruct the dust continuum (magnified by a factor \u03bc\u2004\u2243\u20045.0) and molecular emission lines (magnified by \u03bc\u2004\u223c\u20044\u2005\u2212\u20055) in the source plane, which probe scales of \u223c0.\u20331 (or 800 pc). The 12CO(9\u2005\u2212\u20058) and H2O(202\u2005\u2212\u2005111) emission lines have comparable spatial and kinematic distributions; the source-plane reconstructions do not clearly distinguish between a one-component and a two-component scenario, but the latter, which reveals two compact rotating components with sizes of \u22481 kpc that are likely merging, more naturally accounts for the broad line widths observed in HerBS-89a. In the core of HerBS-89a, very dense gas with nH2\u2004\u223c\u2004107\u2005\u2212\u20059 cm\u22123 is revealed by the NH2 emission lines and the possible HCN(11\u2005\u2212\u200510) absorption line. HerBS-89a is a powerful star forming galaxy with a molecular gas mass of Mmol\u2004=\u2004(2.1\u2005\u00b1\u20050.4) \u00d7 1011\u2006M\u2299, an infrared luminosity of LIR\u2004=\u2004(4.6\u2005\u00b1\u20050.4) \u00d7 1012\u2006L\u2299, and a dust mass of Mdust\u2004=\u2004(2.6\u2005\u00b1\u20050.2) \u00d7 109\u2006M\u2299, yielding a dust-to-gas ratio \u03b4GDR\u2004\u2248\u200480. We derive a star formation rate SFR\u2004=\u2004614\u2005\u00b1\u200559\u2006M\u2299 yr\u22121 and a depletion timescale \u03c4depl\u2004=\u2004(3.4\u2005\u00b1\u20051.0) \u00d7 108 years. The OH+ and CH+ absorption lines, which trace low (\u223c100 cm\u22123) density molecular gas, all have their main velocity component red-shifted by \u0394V\u2004\u223c\u2004100 km s\u22121 relative to the global CO reservoir. We argue that these absorption lines trace a rare example of gas inflow toward the center of a galaxy, indicating that HerBS-89a is accreting gas from its surroundings.",
"Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux due to recent upheavals in our view of mass loss and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2\u20133 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss\u2014are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.",
"We present the first results of a project called SAGAN, which is dedicated solely to the studies of relatively rare megaparsec-scale radio galaxies in the Universe, called giant radio galaxies (GRGs). We have identified 162 new GRGs primarily from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey with sizes ranging from \u223c0.71 Mpc to \u223c2.82 Mpc in the redshift range of \u223c0.03\u22120.95, of which 23 are hosted by quasars (giant radio quasars). As part of the project SAGAN, we have created a database of all known GRGs, the GRG catalogue, from the literature (including our new sample); it includes 820 sources. For the first time, we present the multi-wavelength properties of the largest sample of GRGs. This provides new insights into their nature. Our results establish that the distributions of the radio spectral index and the black hole mass of GRGs do not differ from the corresponding distributions of normal-sized radio galaxies (RGs). However, GRGs have a lower Eddington ratio than RGs. Using the mid-infrared data, we classified GRGs in terms of their accretion mode: either a high-power radiatively efficient high-excitation state, or a radiatively inefficient low-excitation state. This enabled us to compare key physical properties of their active galactic nuclei, such as the black hole mass, spin, Eddington ratio, jet kinetic power, total radio power, magnetic field, and size. We find that GRGs in high-excitation state statistically have larger sizes, stronger radio power, jet kinetic power, and higher Eddington ratio than those in low-excitation state. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the black hole Eddington ratio and the scaled jet kinetic power, which suggests a disc-jet coupling. Our environmental study reveals that \u223c10% of all GRGs may reside at the centres of galaxy clusters, in a denser galactic environment, while the majority appears to reside in a sparse environment. The probability of finding the brightest cluster galaxy as a GRG is quite low and even lower for high-mass clusters. We present new results for GRGs that range from black hole mass to large-scale environment properties. We discuss their formation and growth scenarios, highlighting the key physical factors that cause them to reach their gigantic size.",
"Observational results of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields are reviewed, including the fields in supernova remnants and loops, interstellar filaments and clouds, Hii regions and bubbles, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web. A variety of approaches are used to investigate these fields. The orientations of magnetic fields in interstellar filaments and molecular clouds are traced by polarized thermal dust emission and starlight polarization. The field strengths and directions along the line of sight in dense clouds and cores are measured by Zeeman splitting of emission or absorption lines. The large-scale magnetic fields in the Milky Way have been best probed by Faraday rotation measures of a large number of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources. The coherent Galactic magnetic fields are found to follow the spiral arms and have their direction reversals in arms and interarm regions in the disk. The azimuthal fields in the halo reverse their directions below and above the Galactic plane. The orientations of organized magnetic fields in nearby galaxies have been observed through polarized synchrotron emission. Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium have been indicated by diffuse radio halos, polarized radio relics, and Faraday rotations of embedded radio galaxies and background sources. Sparse evidence for very weak magnetic fields in the cosmic web is the detection of the faint radio bridge between the Coma cluster and A1367. Future observations should aim at the 3D tomography of the large-scale coherent magnetic fields in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, a better description of intracluster field properties, and firm detections of intergalactic magnetic fields in the cosmic web.",
"Stars with zero-age main sequence masses between 140 and 260\u2006M\u2299 are thought to explode as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). During their thermonuclear runaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive nickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far. SN 2018ibb is a hydrogen-poor SLSN at z\u2004=\u20040.166 that evolves extremely slowly compared to the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored its photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the near-infrared (NIR) with 2\u201310 m class telescopes. SN 2018ibb radiated > 3\u2005\u00d7\u20051051\u2006erg during its evolution, and its bolometric light curve reached > 2\u2005\u00d7\u20051044\u2006erg\u2006s\u22121 at its peak. The long-lasting rise of > 93 rest-frame days implies a long diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN mechanism naturally provides both the energy source (56Ni) and the long diffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions as to their photometric and spectroscopic properties. SN 2018ibb complies with most tests on the light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, and potentially all tests with the interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require 25\u201344 M\u2299 of freshly nucleosynthesised 56Ni, pointing to the explosion of a metal-poor star with a helium core mass of 120\u2013130 M\u2299 at the time of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection of [Co\u202fII] \u03bb 1.025 \u03bcm, which has never been observed in any other PISN candidate or SLSN before. We observe a significant excess in the blue part of the optical spectrum during the nebular phase, which is in tension with predictions of existing PISN models. However, we have compelling observational evidence for an eruptive mass-loss episode of the progenitor of SN 2018ibb shortly before the explosion, and our dataset reveals that the interaction of the SN ejecta with this oxygen-rich circumstellar material contributed to the observed emission. That may explain this specific discrepancy with PISN models. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a black hole, can be excluded with high confidence. This makes SN 2018ibb by far the best candidate for being a PISN, to date.",

The analysis of high-zLy\u03b1-emitting sources over such a wide area is unprecedented and allows us to select approximately 14\u2006500 hyper-bright (LLy\u03b1\u2004> \u20041043.3\u2006erg\u2006s\u22121) Ly\u03b1-emitting candidates.

Our results unveil the Schechter exponential decay of the brightest-end of the Ly\u03b1LF in great detail, complementing the power-law component of previous determinations at 43.3 \u2272 Log10(LLy\u03b1/erg s\u22121) \u2272 44.

These values are significantly different from the typical Schechter parameters measured for the Ly\u03b1LF of high-zstar-forming Lyman-\u03b1emitters (LAEs). This implies thatz\u200b\u2004> \u2004\u200b2 AGNs/QSOs (likely dominant in our samples) are described by a structurally different LF from that used to describez\u200b\u2004> \u2004\u200b2 star-forming LAEs, namelyLQSOs*~ 100LLAEs*and \u03a6QSOs*~ 10\u22123\u03a6LAEs*, with the transition between the two LFs happening atLLy\u03b1\u2006\u2004\u223c\u2004\u20061043.5\u2006erg\u2006s\u22121.

"Context. The triggering and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the interaction of the AGN with its host galaxy is an important topic in extragalactic astrophysics. Radio sources with peaked spectra (peaked spectrum sources, PSS) and compact symmetric objects (CSO) are powerful, compact, and presumably young AGNs and therefore particularly suitable to study aspects of the AGN-host connection.Aims. We use a statistical approach to investigate properties of a PSS-CSO sample that are related to host galaxies and could potentially shed light on the link between host galaxies and AGNs. The main goal is to compare the PSS-CSO sample with a matching comparison sample of extended sources (ECS) to see if the two have significant differences.Methods. We analysed composite spectra, diagnostic line diagrams, multi-band spectral energy distributions (MBSEDs), star formation (SF) indicators, morphologies, and cluster environments for a sample of 121 PSSs and CSOs for which spectra are available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The statistical results were compared with those of the ECS sample, where we generally considered the two subsamples of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and radio galaxies separately. The analysis is based on a large set of archival data in the spectral range from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared.Results. We find significant differences between the PSS-CSO and the ECS sample. In particular, we find that the ECS sample has a higher proportion of passive galaxies with a lower star formation activity. This applies to both sub-samples (QSOs or radio galaxies) as well as to the entire sample. The star formation rates of the PSS-CSO host galaxies with available data are typically in the range \u223c0 to 5\u2006\u2133\u2299 yr\u22121, and the stellar masses are in the range 3\u2005\u00d7\u20051011 to 1012\u2006\u2133\u2299. Secondly, in agreement with previous results, we find a remarkably high proportion of PSS-CSO host galaxies with merger signatures. The merger fraction of the PSS-CSO sample is 0.61\u2005\u00b1\u20050.07, which is significantly higher than that of the comparison sample (0.15\u2005\u00b1\u20050.06). We suggest that this difference can be explained by assuming that the majority of the PSSs and CSOs cannot evolve to extended radio sources and are therefore not represented in our comparison sample.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 All neutral atomic hydrogen gas and a large fraction of the molecular gas in the Milky Way Galaxy and external galaxies lie in PDRs, and PDRs are the origin of most of the nonstellar infrared (IR) and the millimeter CO emission from a galaxy. On the surfaces (Av< 1\u22123) of interstellar clouds, the absorption of far ultraviolet (FUV) photons (h\u03bd < 13.6 eV) by gas and dust grains leads to intense emission of [C II] 158 \u03bcm, [O I] 63, 146 \u03bcm, and H2rovibrational transitions, as well as IR dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features. Deeper in PDRs, CO rotational and [C I] 370, 609 \u03bcm lines originate. The transition of H to H2and C+to CO occurs within PDRs. Theoretical models compared with observations diagnose such physical parameters as the density and temperature structure, the elemental abundances, and the FUV radiation field in PDRs. Applications include clouds next to H II regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebulae, red giant outflows, circumstellar gas around young stars, diffuse clouds, the warm neutral medium (WNM), and molecular clouds in the interstellar radiation field: in summary, much of the interstellar medium in galaxies. This review focuses on dense PDRs in the Milky Way Galaxy. Theoretical PDR models help explain the observed correlation of the CO J = 1\u20130 luminosity with the molecular mass and also suggest FUV-induced feedback mechanisms that may regulate star formation rates and the column density through giant molecular clouds.",
"Rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission lines probe electron densities, gas-phase abundances, metallicities, and ionization parameters of the emitting star-forming galaxies and their environments. The strongest main UV emission line, Ly\u03b1, has been instrumental in advancing the general knowledge of galaxy formation in the early universe. However, observing Ly\u03b1emission becomes increasingly challenging atz\u2004\u2273\u20046 when the neutral hydrogen fraction of the circumgalactic and intergalactic media increases. Secondary weaker UV emission lines provide important alternative methods for studying galaxy properties at high redshift. We present a large sample of rest-frame UV emission line sources at intermediate redshift for calibrating and exploring the connection between secondary UV lines and the emitting galaxies\u2019 physical properties and their Ly\u03b1emission. The sample of 2052 emission line sources with 1.5\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20046.4 was collected from integral field data from the MUSE-Wide and MUSE-Deep surveys taken as part of Guaranteed Time Observations. The objects were selected through untargeted source detection (i.e., no preselection of sources as in dedicated spectroscopic campaigns) in the three-dimensional MUSE data cubes. We searched optimally extracted one-dimensional spectra of the full sample for UV emission features via emission line template matching, resulting in a sample of more than 100 rest-frame UV emission line detections. We show that the detection efficiency of (non-Ly\u03b1) UV emission lines increases with survey depth, and that the emission line strength of He\u202fII\u03bb1640 \u00c5, [O\u202fIII]\u03bb1661 + O\u202fIII]\u03bb1666, and [Si\u202fIII]\u03bb1883 + Si\u202fIII]\u03bb1892 correlate with the strength of [C\u202fIII]\u03bb1907 + C\u202fIII]\u03bb1909. The rest-frame equivalent width (EW0) of [C\u202fIII]\u03bb1907 + C\u202fIII]\u03bb1909 is found to be roughly 0.22 \u00b1 0.18 of EW0(Ly\u03b1). We measured the velocity offsets of resonant emission lines with respect to systemic tracers. For C\u202fIV\u03bb1548 + C\u202fIV\u03bb1551 we find that \u0394vC\u202fIV\u2272 250 km s\u22121, whereas \u0394vLy\u03b1falls in the range of 250\u2212500 km s\u22121which is in agreement with previous results from the literature. The electron densitynemeasured from [Si\u202fIII]\u03bb1883 + Si\u202fIII]\u03bb1892 and [C\u202fIII]\u03bb1907 + C\u202fIII]\u03bb1909 line flux ratios is generally < 105cm\u22123and the gas-phase abundance is below solar at 12\u2005+\u2005log10(O/H)\u22488. Lastly, we used \u201cPhotoIonization Model Probability Density Functions\u201d to infer physical parameters of the full sample and individual systems based on photoionization model parameter grids and observational constraints from our UV emission line searches.

" The observable characteristics and subsequent evolution of young stellar populations is dominated by their massive stars. As our understanding of those massive stars and the factors affecting their evolution improves, so our interpretation of distant, unresolved stellar systems can also advance. As observations increasingly probe the distant Universe, and the rare low-metallicity starbursts nearby, so the opportunity arises for these two fields to complement one another and leads to an improved conception of both stars and galaxies. Here, we review the current state of the art in modeling of massive star\u2013dominated stellar populations and discuss their applications and implications for interpreting the distant Universe. Our principal findings include the following: \u25aa Binary evolutionary pathways must be included to understand the stellar populations in early galaxies. \u25aa Observations constraining the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of early galaxies are showing that current models are incomplete. The best current guess is that some form of accretion onto compact remnants is required. \u25aa The evolution and fates of very massive stars, on the order of 100 M\u2299 and above, may be key to fully understand aspects of early galaxies.

"Context.Mergers and tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are a fundamental prediction of the Lambda-cold dark matter cosmology. These events are thought to provide important observational diagnostics of non-linear structure formation. Stellar streams in the Milky Way and Andromeda are spectacular evidence for ongoing satellite disruption. However, constructing a statistically meaningful sample of tidal streams beyond the Local Group has proven a daunting observational challenge, and the full potential for deepening our understanding of galaxy assembly using stellar streams has yet to be realised.Aims.Here we introduce the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey, a systematic imaging survey of tidal features associated with dwarf galaxy accretion around a sample of \u223c3100 nearby galaxies withinz\u2004\u223c\u20040.02, including about 940 Milky Way analogues.Methods.Our survey exploits public deep imaging data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, which reach surface brightness as faint as \u223c29 mag arcsec\u22122in therband. As a proof of concept of our survey, we report the detection and broad-band photometry of 24 new stellar streams in the local Universe.Results.We discuss how these observations can yield new constraints on galaxy formation theory through comparison to mock observations from cosmological galaxy simulations. These tests will probe the present-day mass assembly rate of galaxies, the stellar populations and orbits of satellites, the growth of stellar halos, and the resilience of stellar disks to satellite bombardment.",
" The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research. ",
"The first flare on the Sun was observed exactly 150 years ago. During most of the long history, only secondary effects have been noticed, so flares remained a riddle. Now the primary flare products, high-energy electrons and ions, can be spatially resolved in hard X-rays (HXRs) and gamma rays on the Sun. Soft X-rays (SXRs) are observed from most stars, including young stellar objects. Structure and bulk motions of the corona are imaged on the Sun in high temperature lines and are inferred from line shifts in stellar coronae. Magnetic reconnection is the trigger for reorganization of the magnetic field into a lower energy configuration. A large fraction of the energy is converted into nonthermal particles that transport the energy to higher density gas, heating it to SXR-emitting temperatures. Flares on young stars are several orders of magnitude more luminous and more frequent; they significantly ionize protoplanetary disks and planetary ionospheres.",
"The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a volume-complete sample of \u223c850 Galactic evolved stars within 3\u2009kpc at (sub-)mm wavelengths, observed in the CO J\u00a0= (2\u20131) and (3\u20132) rotational lines, and the sub-mm continuum, using the James Clark Maxwell Telescope and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. NESS consists of five tiers, based on distances and dust-production rate (DPR). We define a new metric for estimating the distances to evolved stars and compare its results to Gaia EDR3. Replicating other studies, the most-evolved, highly enshrouded objects in the Galactic Plane dominate the dust returned by our sources, and we initially estimate a total DPR of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 from our sample. Our sub-mm fluxes are systematically higher and spectral indices are typically shallower than dust models typically predict. The 450/850 $\\mu$m spectral indices are consistent with the blackbody Rayleigh\u2013Jeans regime, suggesting a large fraction of evolved stars have unexpectedly large envelopes of cold dust.",
"Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic \u201cdark ages\u201d to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z\u22481.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than \u223c1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.",
" This review examines the state-of-the-art knowledge of high-mass star and massive cluster formation, gained from ambitious observational surveys, which acknowledges the multiscale characteristics of these processes. After a brief overview of theoretical models and main open issues, we present observational searches for the evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation, first among high-luminosity sources and more recently among young massive protostars and the elusive high-mass prestellar cores. We then introduce the most likely evolutionary scenario for high-mass star formation, which emphasizes the link of high-mass star formation to massive cloud and cluster formation. Finally, we introduce the first attempts to search for variations of the star-formation activity and cluster formation in molecular cloud complexes in the most extreme star-forming sites and across the Milky Way. The combination of Galactic plane surveys and high\u2013angular resolution images with submillimeter facilities such as Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are prerequisites to make significant progress in the forthcoming decade.

"Context.The different elemental abundances of the photosphere and the corona are striking features of not only the Sun, but of other stars as well. This phenomenon is known as the first ionisation potential (FIP) effect, and its strength can be characterized by the FIP bias, the logarithmic abundance difference between low- and high-FIP elements in the corona, compared to the photosphere. The FIP bias was shown to depend on the surface temperature of the star.Aims.We aim to extend theTeff\u2212FIP bias relationship to a larger stellar sample and analyse the effect of other astrophysical parameters on the relation (e.g. surface gravity, age, activity indicators).Methods.We compiled FIP bias and other parameters for 59 stars for which coronal composition is available, now including evolved stars. Using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, we searched for correlations with other astrophysical parameters within the sample that may influence the stellar FIP bias.Results.Adding stars to theTeff\u2212FIP bias diagram unveiled new features in its structure. In addition to the previously known relationship, there appears to be a second branch: a parallel sequence about 0.5 dex above it. While theTeffremains the main determinant of the FIP bias, other parameters such as stellar activity indicators also have influence. We find three clusters in the FIP bias determinant parameter space. One distinct group is formed by the evolved stars. Two groups contain main sequence stars in continuation separated roughly by the sign change of the FIP-bias value.Conclusions.The new branch of theTeff\u2212FIP bias diagram contains stars with higher activity level, in terms of X-ray flux and rotational velocity. The Rossby number also seems to be important, indicating possible dependence on the type of dynamo operating in these stars influencing their FIP bias. The two main-sequence clusters run from the earliest spectral types of A-F with shallow convection zones through G-K-early-M stars with gradually deeper convection zones, and they end with the fully convective M dwarf stars, depicting the change of the dynamo type with the internal differences of the main sequence stars in connection with the FIP-bias values.",
"Context. The discrepancy between the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the lithium abundance observed in the oldest stars of our Galaxy, known as the cosmological lithium problem, has long been regarded as a challenge to the fields of both cosmology and astrophysics.Aims. In light of recent theoretical advances concerning the transport of chemicals and angular momentum in Population I low-mass stars, we re-examine the stellar depletion hypothesis to explain the lithium plateau, which spans a wide range of metallicities over a specific range of stellar effective temperature.Methods. We computed stellar evolution models with the code STAREVOL, including the same input physics that enable self-consistent reproduction of the Li depletion in the Sun and stars in open clusters, while accounting for internal rotation consistent with asteroseismic constraints. In addition to atomic diffusion and parametric turbulence, which were considered in previous studies of Li depletion along the plateau, our models include rotation-induced hydrodynamical processes and additional parametric viscosity for the transport of angular momentum as well as penetrative convection with a rotational dependence, and magnetic braking.Results. As in the case of Pop I stars, the mixing obtained with the current prescriptions for vertical and horizontal shear turbulence induced by rotation is insufficient to reproduce the Li constraints, and parametric turbulence is required. Even if the nature of the turbulence has yet to be identified, we show that the compactness of Pop II low-mass dwarf stars shall naturally lead to similar Li depletion over a large domain in the [Fe/H]\u2013Teff plane, resulting in a plateau with little dispersion. We calibrated the efficiency of the turbulence to fit the abundance of Li in Pop II stars selected from the GALAH DR3 spectroscopic survey and from an homogeneous reanalysis of abundances from the literature. This calibration also enables the reproduction of lithium and magnesium trends in post-turnoff stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752. The same stellar structure considerations consistently explain the observed change of Li depletion and the dispersion regime for [Fe/H] above \u22121.5 dex, that is, at the transition in metallicity between Pop II to Pop I stars.Conclusions. Our results provide new constraints to the physical processes that transport chemicals and angular momentum in stellar interiors. They offer a comprehensive way to reproduce the observed Li patterns in low-mass dwarf stars across the entire Galactic metallicity range covered by spectroscopic surveys, including the most Fe-poor regime, as supported by the Li value in the non-CEMP star that lies on the plateau at [Fe/H] below \u22125.8 dex. Our careful analysis of the other very metal-poor stars with lower Li abundances supports the environmental origin of the so-called meltdown regime. Finally, the expected plateau-to-scatter transition pattern further supports the stellar solution to the cosmological problem.",
" Burst oscillations, a phenomenon observed in a significant fraction of Type I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts, involve the development of highly asymmetric brightness patches in the burning surface layers of accreting neutron stars. Intrinsically interesting as nuclear phenomena, they are also important as probes of dense matter physics and the strong gravity, high magnetic field environment of the neutron star surface. Burst oscillation frequency is also used to measure stellar spin, and doubles the sample of rapidly rotating (above 10 Hz) accreting neutron stars with known spins. Although the mechanism remains mysterious, burst oscillation models must take into account thermonuclear flame spread, nuclear processes, rapid rotation, and the dynamical role of the magnetic field. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of burst oscillations, an assessment of the status of the theoretical models that are being developed to explain them, and an overview of how they can be used to constrain neutron star properties such as spin, mass, and radius.

"We review the development of dust science from the first ground-based astronomical observations of dust in space to compositional analysis of individual dust particles and their source objects. A multitude of observational techniques is available for the scientific study of space dust: from meteors and interplanetary dust particles collected in the upper atmosphere to dust analyzed in situ or returned to Earth. In situ dust detectors have been developed from simple dust impact detectors determining the dust hazard in Earth orbit to dust telescopes capable of providing compositional analysis and accurate trajectory determination of individual dust particles in space. The concept of Dust Astronomy has been developed, recognizing that dust particles, like photons, carry information from remote sites in space and time. From knowledge of the dust particles\u2019 birthplace and their bulk properties, we learn about the remote environment out of which the particles were formed. Dust Observatory missions like Cassini, Stardust, and Rosetta study Saturn\u2019s satellites and rings and the dust environments of comet Wild\u00a02 and comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, respectively. Supplemented by simulations of dusty processes in the laboratory we are beginning to understand the dusty environments in space.",
"Knowledge of the bulk Lorentz factor \u03930 of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) allows us to compute their comoving frame properties shedding light on their physics. Upon collisions with the circumburst matter, the fireball of a GRB starts to decelerate, producing a peak or a break (depending on the circumburst density profile) in the light curve of the afterglow. Considering all bursts with known redshift and with an early coverage of their emission, we find 67 GRBs (including one short event) with a peak in their optical or GeV light curves at a time tp. For another 106 GRBs we set an upper limit tpUL. The measure of tp provides the bulk Lorentz factor \u03930 of the fireball before deceleration. We show that tp is due to the dynamics of the fireball deceleration and not to the passage of a characteristic frequency of the synchrotron spectrum across the optical band. Considering the tp of 66 long GRBs and the 85 most constraining upper limits, we estimate \u03930 or a lower limit \u03930LL. Using censored data analysis methods, we reconstruct the most likely distribution of tp. All tp are larger than the time Tp,\u03b3 when the prompt \u03b3-ray emission peaks, and are much larger than the time Tph when the fireball becomes transparent, that is, tp>Tp,\u03b3>Tph. The reconstructed distribution of \u03930 has median value ~300 (150) for a uniform (wind) circumburst density profile. In the comoving frame, long GRBs have typical isotropic energy, luminosity, and peak energy \u27e8 Eiso \u27e9  = 3(8) \u00d7 1050 erg, \u27e8 Liso \u27e9  = 3(15) \u00d7 1047 erg s-1, and \u27e8 Epeak \u27e9  = 1(2) keV in the homogeneous (wind) case. We confirm that the significant correlations between \u03930 and the rest frame isotropic energy (Eiso), luminosity (Liso), and peak energy (Ep) are not due to selection effects. When combined, they lead to the observed Ep\u2212Eiso and Ep\u2212Liso correlations. Finally, assuming a typical opening angle of 5 degrees, we derive the distribution of the jet baryon loading which is centered around a few 10-6M\u2299. ",
"Massive stars are often found in binary systems, and it has been argued that binary products boost the ionizing radiation of stellar populations. Accurate predictions for binary products are needed to understand and quantify their contribution to cosmic reionization. We investigate the contribution of stars stripped in binaries because (1) they are, arguably, the best-understood products of binary evolution, (2) we recently produced the first radiative transfer calculations for the atmospheres of these stripped stars that predict their ionizing spectra, and (3) they are very promising sources because they boost the ionizing emission of stellar populations at late times. This allows stellar feedback to clear the surroundings such that a higher fraction of their photons can escape and ionize the intergalactic medium. Combining our detailed predictions for the ionizing spectra with a simple cosmic reionization model, we estimate that stripped stars contributed tens of percent of the photons that caused cosmic reionization of hydrogen, depending on the assumed escape fractions. More importantly, stripped stars harden the ionizing emission. We estimate that the spectral index for the ionizing part of the spectrum can increase to \u22121 compared to \u2272\u2005\u2212\u20052 for single stars. At high redshift, stripped stars and massive single stars combined dominate the He\u202fII-ionizing emission, but we expect that active galactic nuclei drive cosmic helium reionization. Further observational consequences we expect are (1) high ionization states for the intergalactic gas surrounding stellar systems, such as C\u202fIV and Si\u202fIV, and (2) additional heating of the intergalactic medium of up to a few thousand Kelvin. Quantifying these warrants the inclusion of accurate models for stripped stars and other binary products in full cosmological simulations.",
"Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a distinctive but elusive family of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) characterised by their tight orbits and degenerate donor stars. Here we present UltraCompCAT, the first online and comprehensive catalogue of UCXBs. The initial version of UltraCompCAT comprises 49 sources, including 20 confirmed UCXBs (those with a measured orbital period shorter than 80 min) and 25 systems that we label \u2018candidates\u2019 based on their multi-wavelength phenomenology. For completeness, we also include four LMXBs with orbital periods in the range of 80 to 120 min, since they might be related to (e.g. close progenitors) or even part of the UCXB population that evolved towards longer periods. We discuss the orbital period and Galactic distribution of the catalogue sample. We provide evidence for the presence of at least two separate groups of UCXBs, one formed by persistent systems with orbital periods shorter than 30 min and a second group of transient objects (70 %) with periods in the range of 40 to 60 min. We show that the former group is dominated by sources formed in globular clusters, while the latter accounts for the (known) UCXB population in the Galactic field. We discuss the possible evolutionary channels for the two groups.",
"Twenty years ago, GRB 980425/SN 1998bw revealed that long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are physically associated with broad-lined type-Ic supernovae (SNe). Since then more than 1000 long GRBs have been localized to high angular precision, but only in \u223c50 cases has the underlying SN component been identified. Using the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) multi-channel imager at ESO/La Silla, during the last ten years we have devoted a substantial amount of observing time to reveal and study SN components in long-GRB afterglows. Here we report on four more GRB SNe (associated with GRBs 071112C, 111228A, 120714B, and 130831A) which were discovered and/or followed-up with GROND and whose redshifts lie between z\u2004=\u20040.4 and 0.8. We study their afterglow light curves, follow the associated SN bumps over several weeks, and characterize their host galaxies. Using SN 1998bw as a template, the derived SN explosion parameters are fully consistent with the corresponding properties of the currently known GRB-SN ensemble, with no evidence for an evolution of their properties as a function of redshift. In two cases (GRB 120714B/SN 2012eb at z\u2004=\u20040.398 and GRB 130831A/SN 2013fu at z\u2004=\u20040.479) additional Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopy of the associated SNe revealed a photospheric expansion velocity at maximum light of about 40 000 and 20 000 km s\u22121, respectively. For GRB 120714B, which was an intermediate-luminosity burst, we find additional evidence for a black-body component in the light of the optical transient at early times, similar to what has been detected in some GRB SNe at lower redshifts.",
"Magnetic fields can drastically change predictions of evolutionary models of massive stars via mass-loss quenching, magnetic braking, and efficient angular momentum transport, which we aim to quantify in this work. We use the mesa software instrument to compute an extensive main-sequence grid of stellar structure and evolution models, as well as isochrones, accounting for the effects attributed to a surface fossil magnetic field. The grid is densely populated in initial mass (3\u201360\u00a0M\u2299), surface equatorial magnetic field strength (0\u201350\u00a0kG), and metallicity (representative of the Solar neighbourhood and the Magellanic Clouds). We use two magnetic braking and two chemical mixing schemes and compare the model predictions for slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched (\u2018Group\u00a02\u2019) stars with observations in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We quantify a range of initial field strengths that allow for producing Group\u00a02 stars and find that typical values (up to a few kG) lead to solutions. Between the subgrids, we find notable departures in surface abundances and evolutionary paths. In our magnetic models, chemical mixing is always less efficient compared to non-magnetic models due to the rapid spin-down. We identify that quasi-chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution by efficient mixing could be prevented by fossil magnetic fields. We recommend comparing this grid of evolutionary models with spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic observations with the goals of (i) revisiting the derived stellar parameters of known magnetic stars, and (ii) observationally constraining the uncertain magnetic braking and chemical mixing schemes.",

" The detection of exoplanets orbiting other stars has revolutionized our view of the cosmos. First results suggest that it is teeming with a fascinating diversity of rocky planets, including those in the habitable zone. Even our closest star, Proxima Centauri, harbors a small planet in its habitable zone, Proxima b. With the next generation of telescopes, we will be able to peer into the atmospheres of rocky planets and get a glimpse into other worlds. Using our own planet and its wide range of biota as a Rosetta stone, we explore how we could detect habitability and signs of life on exoplanets over interstellar distances. Current telescopes are not yet powerful enough to characterize habitable exoplanets, but the next generation of telescopes that is already being built will have the capabilities to characterize close-by habitable worlds. The discussion on what makes a planet a habitat and how to detect signs of life is lively. This review will show the latest results, the challenges of how to identify and characterize such habitable worlds, and how near-future telescopes will revolutionize the field. For the first time in human history, we have developed the technology to detect potential habitable worlds. Finding thousands of exoplanets has taken the field of comparative planetology beyond the Solar System. ",
"We present extensive datasets for a class of intermediate-luminosity optical transients known as luminous red novae. They show double-peaked light curves, with an initial rapid luminosity rise to a blue peak (at \u221213 to \u221215 mag), which is followed by a longer-duration red peak that sometimes is attenuated, resembling a plateau. The progenitors of three of them (NGC 4490\u22122011OT1, M 101\u22122015OT1, and SNhunt248), likely relatively massive blue to yellow stars, were also observed in a pre-eruptive stage when their luminosity was slowly increasing. Early spectra obtained during the first peak show a blue continuum with superposed prominent narrow Balmer lines, with P Cygni profiles. Lines of Fe II are also clearly observed, mostly in emission. During the second peak, the spectral continuum becomes much redder, H\u03b1 is barely detected, and a forest of narrow metal lines is observed in absorption. Very late-time spectra (\u223c6 months after blue peak) show an extremely red spectral continuum, peaking in the infrared (IR) domain. H\u03b1 is detected in pure emission at such late phases, along with broad absorption bands due to molecular overtones (such as TiO, VO). We discuss a few alternative scenarios for luminous red novae. Although major instabilities of single massive stars cannot be definitely ruled out, we favour a common envelope ejection in a close binary system, with possibly a final coalescence of the two stars. The similarity between luminous red novae and the outburst observed a few months before the explosion of the Type IIn SN 2011ht is also discussed.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 We review the wide range of observed properties of Herbig Ae/Be stars and try to combine this rich data set into a consistent picture of their circumstellar environment and evolutionary status.

Envelopes can dominate the spectral energy distributions on large angular scales. In some stars, a fairly massive disk persists until the star has reached the main sequence. The evidence for an evolutionary link between isolated Herbig Ae/Be stars and \u03b2 Pictoris is summarized.",

" Magnetic fields are present in a wide variety of stars throughout the HR diagram and play a role at basically all evolutionary stages, from very-low-mass dwarfs to very massive stars, and from young star-forming molecular clouds and protostellar accretion discs to evolved giants/supergiants and magnetic white dwarfs/neutron stars. These fields range from a few \u03bcG (e.g., in molecular clouds) to TG and more (e.g., in magnetic neutron stars); in nondegenerate stars in particular, they feature large-scale topologies varying from simple nearly axisymmetric dipoles to complex nonaxsymmetric structures, and from mainly poloidal to mainly toroidal topologies. After recalling the main techniques of detecting and modeling stellar magnetic fields, we review the existing properties of magnetic fields reported in cool, hot, and young nondegenerate stars and protostars, and discuss our understanding of the origin of these fields and their impact on the birth and life of stars.

"Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is \u223c0.1 AU\u22123 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.\u25aa1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov are both gravitationally unbound, subkilometer bodies showing nongravitational acceleration.\u25aaThe acceleration of 1I/\u2018Oumuamua in the absence of measurable mass loss requires either a strained explanation in terms of recoil from sublimating supervolatiles or the action of radiation pressure on a nucleus with an ultralow mass column density, \u223c1 kg m\u22122.\u25aa2I/Borisov is a strong source of CO and H2O, which together account for its activity and nongravitational acceleration.\u25aaThe interlopers are most likely planetesimals from the protoplanetary disks of other stars, ejected by gravitational scattering from planets. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have dynamical ages \u223c108 and \u223c109 years, respectively.\u25aaForthcoming observatories should detect interstellar interlopers every year, which will provide a rapid boost to our knowledge of the population.",
"A dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016 with GROND, a seven-channel optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla, In this first of a series of papers, we describe the GRB observing plan, providing first readings of all so far unpublished GRB afterglow measurements and some observing statistics. In total, we observed 514 GRBs with GROND, including 434 Swift-detected GRBs, representing 81% of the observable Swift sample. For GROND-observations within 30 min of the GRB trigger, the optical/NIR afterglow detection rate is 81% for long- and 57% for short-duration GRBs. We report the discovery of ten new GRB afterglows plus one candidate, along with redshift estimates (partly improved) for four GRBs and new host detections for seven GRBs. We identify the (already known) afterglow of GRB 140209A as the sixth GRB exhibiting a 2175 \u00c5 dust feature.

"Context. Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were initially reported by visual astronomers as apparent overdensities of bright stars. As observational techniques and analysis methods continue to improve, some of them have been shown to be chance alignments of stars and not true clusters. Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data have provided membership lists for over a thousand clusters, however, many nearby objects listed in the literature have so far evaded detection.Aims. We aim to update the Gaia DR2 cluster census by performing membership determinations for known clusters that had been missed by previous studies and for recently-discovered clusters. We investigate a sub-set of non-detected clusters that, according to their literature parameters, should be easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or disproving the existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially important as their survival or disruption is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of the Milky Way.Methods. We employed the Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and parallax distributions. We used membership lists provided by other authors when available.Results. We derived membership lists for 150 objects, including ten that were already known prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481 clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify with the Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putatively old, relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters.Conclusions. At present, the only confirmed cluster located further than 500 pc away from the Galactic plane within the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects discussed in this study only represent a fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in the catalogues as genuine open clusters and that those lists need further cleaning.",
"Aims.Thanks to the high angular resolution, sensitivity, image fidelity, and frequency coverage of ALMA, we aim to improve our understanding of star formation. One of the breakthroughs expected from ALMA, which is the basis of our Cycle 5 ALMA-IMF Large Program, is the question of the origin of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars. Here we present the ALMA-IMF protocluster selection, first results, and scientific prospects.Methods.ALMA-IMF imaged a total noncontiguous area of ~53 pc2, covering extreme, nearby protoclusters of the Milky Way. We observed 15 massive (2.5 \u221233 \u00d7 103M\u2299), nearby (2\u22125.5 kpc) protoclusters that were selected to span relevant early protocluster evolutionary stages. Our 1.3 and 3 mm observations provide continuum images that are homogeneously sensitive to point-like cores with masses of ~0.2M\u2299and ~0.6M\u2299, respectively, with a matched spatial resolution of ~2000 au across the sample at both wavelengths. Moreover, with the broad spectral coverage provided by ALMA, we detect lines that probe the ionized and molecular gas, as well as complex molecules. Taken together, these data probe the protocluster structure, kinematics, chemistry, and feedback over scales from clouds to filaments to cores.Results.We classify ALMA-IMF protoclusters as Young (six protoclusters), Intermediate (five protoclusters), or Evolved (four proto-clusters) based on the amount of dense gas in the cloud that has potentially been impacted by H\u202fIIregion(s). The ALMA-IMF catalog contains ~700 cores that span a mass range of ~0.15M\u2299to ~250M\u2299at a typical size of ~2100 au. We show that this core sample has no significant distance bias and can be used to build core mass functions (CMFs) at similar physical scales. Significant gas motions, which we highlight here in the G353.41 region, are traced down to core scales and can be used to look for inflowing gas streamers and to quantify the impact of the possible associated core mass growth on the shape of the CMF with time. Our first analysis does not reveal any significant evolution of the matter concentration from clouds to cores (i.e., from 1 pc to 0.01 pc scales) or from the youngest to more evolved protoclusters, indicating that cloud dynamical evolution and stellar feedback have for the moment only had a slight effect on the structure of high-density gas in our sample. Furthermore, the first-look analysis of the line richness toward bright cores indicates that the survey encompasses several tens of hot cores, of which we highlight the most massive in the G351.77 cloud. Their homogeneous characterization can be used to constrain the emerging molecular complexity in protostars of high to intermediate masses.Conclusions.The ALMA-IMF Large Program is uniquely designed to transform our understanding of the IMF origin, taking the effects of cloud characteristics and evolution into account. It will provide the community with an unprecedented database with a high legacy value for protocluster clouds, filaments, cores, hot cores, outflows, inflows, and stellar clusters studies.",
" The Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in August 2003, is the infrared member of NASA's Great Observatory family. Spitzer combines the intrinsic sensitivity of a cryogenic telescope in space with the imaging and spectroscopic power of modern infrared detector arrays. This review covers early results from Spitzer that have produced major advances in our understanding of our own solar system and phenomena within the Galaxy. Spitzer has made the first detection of light from extrasolar planets, characterized planet-forming and planetary debris disks around solar-type stars, showed that substellar objects with masses smaller than 10 MJup form through the same processes as do solar-mass stars, and studied in detail the composition of cometary ejecta in our Solar System. Spitzer's major technical advances will pave the way for yet more powerful future instruments. Spitzer should operate with full capabilities well into 2009, enabling several additional cycles of discovery and follow-up. ",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Accretion disks are important for many astrophysical phenomena, including galactic nuclei, interacting binary stars, and young stellar objects. The central issue in the theory of accretion disks is to identify the dominant mechanisms that regulate angular momentum transfer and mass flow in a variety of contexts. In the first part of this review, we described some recent advances in the study of the physical processes that may be present in accretion disks. Concurrent with these theoretical developments, the arrival of high-resolution astronomical instruments has led to explosive progress on the observational side. In many cases, the study of accretion disks has evolved from their inferred presence based on circumstantial evidence to direct imaging and detailed spectral analyses. Here, we summarize the theoretical interpretation of these data. We review the constraints that may be imposed on the efficiency and nature of angular momentum transfer processes in a variety of astrophysical contexts. ",
"Potential deleterious health effects to astronauts induced by space radiation is one of the most important long-term risks for human space missions, especially future planetary missions to Mars which require a return-trip duration of about 3\u00a0years with current propulsion technology. In preparation for future human exploration, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was designed to detect and analyze the most biologically hazardous energetic particle radiation on the Martian surface as part of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. RAD has measured the deep space radiation field within the spacecraft during the cruise to Mars and the cosmic ray induced energetic particle radiation on Mars since Curiosity\u2019s landing in August 2012. These first-ever surface radiation data have been continuously providing a unique and direct assessment of the radiation environment on Mars. We analyze the temporal variation of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) radiation and the observed Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events measured by RAD from the launch of MSL until December 2020, i.e., from the pre-maximum of solar cycle 24 throughout its solar minimum until the initial year of Cycle 25. Over the long term, the Mars\u2019s surface GCR radiation increased by about 50% due to the declining solar activity and the weakening heliospheric magnetic field. At different time scales in a shorter term, RAD also detected dynamic variations in the radiation field on Mars. We present and quantify the temporal changes of the radiation field which are mainly caused by: (a) heliospheric influences which include both temporary impacts by solar transients and the long-term solar cycle evolution, (b) atmospheric changes which include the Martian daily thermal tide and seasonal CO$$_2$$\n\n\n2\n\n cycle as well as the altitude change of the rover, (c) topographical changes along the rover path-way causing addition structural shielding and finally (d) solar particle events which occur sporadically and may significantly enhance the radiation within a short time period. Quantification of the variation allows the estimation of the accumulated radiation for a return trip to the surface of Mars under various conditions. The accumulated GCR dose equivalent, via a Hohmann transfer, is about $$0.65 \\pm 0.24$$\n\n0.65\n\u00b1\n0.24\n\n sievert and $$1.59 \\pm 0.12$$\n\n1.59\n\u00b1\n0.12\n\n sievert during solar maximum and minimum periods, respectively. The shielding of the GCR radiation by heliospheric magnetic fields during solar maximum periods is rather efficient in reducing the total GCR-induced radiation for a Mars mission, by more than 50%. However, further contributions by SEPs must also be taken into account. In the future, with advanced nuclear thrusters via a fast transfer, we estimate that the total GCR dose equivalent can be reduced to about 0.2 sievert and 0.5 sievert during solar maximum and minimum periods respectively. In addition, we also examined factors which may further reduce the radiation dose in space and on Mars and discuss the many uncertainties in the interpreting the biological effect based on the current measurement.",
"We present the PHANGS-MUSE survey, a programme that uses the MUSE integral field spectrograph at the ESO VLT to map 19 massive (9.4\u2004< \u2004log(M\u22c6/M\u2299)< 11.0) nearby (D\u2004\u2272\u200420 Mpc) star-forming disc galaxies. The survey consists of 168 MUSE pointings (1\u2032 by 1\u2032 each) and a total of nearly 15\u2005\u00d7\u2005106spectra, covering \u223c1.5\u2005\u00d7\u2005106independent spectra. PHANGS-MUSE provides the first integral field spectrograph view of star formation across different local environments (including galaxy centres, bars, and spiral arms) in external galaxies at a median resolution of 50 pc, better than the mean inter-cloud distance in the ionised interstellar medium. This \u2018cloud-scale\u2019 resolution allows detailed demographics and characterisations of H\u202fIIregions and other ionised nebulae. PHANGS-MUSE further delivers a unique view on the associated gas and stellar kinematics and provides constraints on the star-formation history. The PHANGS-MUSE survey is complemented by dedicated ALMA CO(2\u20131) and multi-band HST observations, therefore allowing us to probe the key stages of the star-formation process from molecular clouds to H\u202fIIregions and star clusters. This paper describes the scientific motivation, sample selection, observational strategy, data reduction, and analysis process of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We present our bespoke automated data-reduction framework, which is built on the reduction recipes provided by ESO but additionally allows for mosaicking and homogenisation of the point spread function.

"Euclid is poised to survey galaxies across a cosmological volume of unprecedented size, providing observations of more than a billion objects distributed over a third of the full sky. Approximately 20 million of these galaxies will have their spectroscopy available, allowing us to map the three-dimensional large-scale structure of the Universe in great detail. This paper investigates prospects for the detection of cosmic voids therein and the unique benefit they provide for cosmological studies. In particular, we study the imprints of dynamic (redshift-space) and geometric (Alcock\u2013Paczynski) distortions of average void shapes and their constraining power on the growth of structure and cosmological distance ratios. To this end, we made use of the Flagship mock catalog, a state-of-the-art simulation of the data expected to be observed with Euclid. We arranged the data into four adjacent redshift bins, each of which contains about 11\u2006000 voids and we estimated the stacked void-galaxy cross-correlation function in every bin. Fitting a linear-theory model to the data, we obtained constraints on f/b and DMH, where f is the linear growth rate of density fluctuations, b the galaxy bias, DM the comoving angular diameter distance, and H the Hubble rate. In addition, we marginalized over two nuisance parameters included in our model to account for unknown systematic effects in the analysis. With this approach, Euclid will be able to reach a relative precision of about 4% on measurements of f/b and 0.5% on DMH in each redshift bin. Better modeling or calibration of the nuisance parameters may further increase this precision to 1% and 0.4%, respectively. Our results show that the exploitation of cosmic voids in Euclid will provide competitive constraints on cosmology even as a stand-alone probe. For example, the equation-of-state parameter, w, for dark energy will be measured with a precision of about 10%, consistent with previous more approximate forecasts.",
"The mantra \u201cknow thy star, know thy planet\u201d has proven to be very important for many aspects of exoplanet science. Here I review how stellar abundances inform our understanding of planet composition and, thus, formation and evolution. In particular, I discuss how:\n\u25aaThe strongest star\u2013planet connection is still the giant planet\u2013metallicity correlation, the strength of which may indicate a break point between the formation of planets versus brown dwarfs.\u25aaWe do not have very good constraints on the lower metallicity limit for planet formation, although new statistics from TESS are helping, and it appears that, at low [Fe/H], \u03b1 elements can substitute for iron as seeds for planet formation.\u25aaThe depletion of refractory versus volatile elements in stellar photospheres (particularly the Sun) was initially suggested as a sign of small planet formation but is challenging to interpret, and small differences in binary star compositions can be attributed mostly to processes other than planet formation.\u25aaWe can and should go beyond comparisons of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in giant planets and their host stars, incorporating other volatile and refractory species to better constrain planet formation pathways.\u25aaThere appears to be a positive correlation between small planet bulk density and host star metallicity, but exactly how closely small planet refractory compositions match those of their host stars\u2014and their true diversity\u2014is still uncertain.\n            ",
" Isolated neutron stars (INSs) were the first sources identified in the field of high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. In the 1970s, only two sources had been identified, the Crab and Vela pulsars. However, although few in number, these objects were crucial in establishing the very concept of a gamma-ray source. Moreover, they opened up significant discovery space in both the theoretical and phenomenological fronts. The need to explain the copious gamma-ray emission of these pulsars led to breakthrough developments in understanding the structure and physics of neutron star (NS) magnetospheres. In parallel, the 20-year-long chase to understand the nature of Geminga unveiled the existence of a radio-quiet, gamma-ray-emitting INS, adding a new dimension to the INS family.  We are living through an extraordinary time of discovery. The current generation of gamma-ray detectors has vastly increased the population of known gamma-ray-emitting NSs. The 100 mark was crossed in 2011, and we are now over 150. The gamma-ray-emitting NS population exhibits roughly equal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet young INSs, plus an astonishing, and unexpected, group of isolated and binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The number of MSPs is growing so rapidly that they are on their way to becoming the most numerous members of the family of gamma-ray-emitting NSs. Even as these findings have set the stage for a revolution in our understanding of gamma-ray-emitting NSs, long-term monitoring of the gamma-ray sky has revealed evidence of flux variability in the Crab Nebula as well as in the pulsed emission from PSR J2021+4026, challenging a four-decades-old, constant-emission paradigm. Now we know that both pulsars and their nebulae can, indeed, display variable emission. ",
"Utilizing spectroscopic observations taken for the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS), new observations from Keck/DEIMOS, and publicly available observations of large samples of star-forming galaxies, we report here on the relationship between the star-formation rate (SFR) and the local environment (\u03b4gal) of galaxies in the early universe (2\u2004<\u2004z\u2004<\u20045). Unlike what is observed at lower redshifts (z\u2004\u2272\u20042), we observe a definite, nearly monotonic increase in the average SFR with increasing galaxy overdensity over more than an order of magnitude in\u03b4gal. The robustness of this trend is quantified by accounting for both uncertainties in our measurements and galaxy populations that are either underrepresented or not present in our sample (e.g., extremely dusty star-forming and quiescent galaxies), and we find that the trend remains significant under all circumstances. This trend appears to be primarily driven by the fractional increase of galaxies in high-density environments that are more massive in their stellar content and are forming stars at a higher rate than their less massive counterparts. We find that, even after stellar mass effects are accounted for, there remains a weak but significant SFR\u2013\u03b4galtrend in our sample implying that additional environmentally related processes are helping to drive this trend. We also find clear evidence that the average SFR of galaxies in the densest environments increases with increasing redshift. These results lend themselves to a picture in which massive gas-rich galaxies coalesce into proto-cluster environments atz\u2004\u2273\u20043, interact with other galaxies or with a forming large-scale medium, subsequently using or losing most of their gas in the process, and begin to seed the nascent red sequence that is present in clusters at slightly lower redshifts.",
"We report the discovery and characterisation of a super-Earth and a sub-Neptune transiting the bright (K = 8.8), quiet, and nearby (37 pc) M3V dwarf TOI-1266. We validate the planetary nature of TOI-1266 b and c using four sectors of TESS photometry and data from the newly-commissioned 1-m SAINT-EX telescope located in San Pedro M\u00e1rtir (M\u00e9xico). We also include additional ground-based follow-up photometry as well as high-resolution spectroscopy and high-angular imaging observations. The inner, larger planet has a radius of R\u2009=\u20092.37\u22120.12+0.16 R\u2295 and an orbital period of 10.9 days. The outer, smaller planet has a radius of R\u2009=\u20091.56\u22120.13+0.15 R\u2295 on an 18.8-day orbit. The data are found to be consistent with circular, co-planar and stable orbits that are weakly influenced by the 2:1 mean motion resonance. Our TTV analysis of the combined dataset enables model-independent constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We find planetary masses of Mp = 13.5\u22129.0+11.0 M\u2295 (<36.8 M\u2295 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 b and 2.2\u22121.5+2.0 M\u2295 (<5.7 M\u2295 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 c. We find small but non-zero orbital eccentricities of 0.09\u22120.05+0.06 (<0.21 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 b and 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 (< 0.10 at 2-\u03c3) for TOI-1266 c. The equilibrium temperatures of both planets are of 413 \u00b1 20 and 344 \u00b1 16 K, respectively, assuming a null Bond albedo and uniform heat redistribution from the day-side to the night-side hemisphere. The host brightness and negligible activity combined with the planetary system architecture and favourable planet-to-star radii ratios makes TOI-1266 an exquisite system for a detailed characterisation.",
"The accurate modelling of the point spread function (PSF) is of paramount importance in astronomical observations, as it allows for the correction of distortions and blurring caused by the telescope and atmosphere. PSF modelling is crucial for accurately measuring celestial objects\u2019 properties. The last decades have brought us a steady increase in the power and complexity of astronomical telescopes and instruments. Upcoming galaxy surveys like Euclid and Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will observe an unprecedented amount and quality of data. Modelling the PSF for these new facilities and surveys requires novel modelling techniques that can cope with the ever-tightening error requirements. The purpose of this review is threefold. Firstly, we introduce the optical background required for a more physically motivated PSF modelling and propose an observational model that can be reused for future developments. Secondly, we provide an overview of the different physical contributors of the PSF, which includes the optic- and detector-level contributors and atmosphere. We expect that the overview will help better understand the modelled effects. Thirdly, we discuss the different methods for PSF modelling from the parametric and non-parametric families for ground- and space-based telescopes, with their advantages and limitations. Validation methods for PSF models are then addressed, with several metrics related to weak-lensing studies discussed in detail. Finally, we explore current challenges and future directions in PSF modelling for astronomical telescopes.",
"The two solar-like stars \u03b1 Cen A and B have long served as cornerstones for stellar physics in virtue of their immediate proximity, association in a visual binary, and masses that bracket that of the Sun. The recent detection of a terrestrial planet in the cool, suspected tertiary Proxima Cen now makes the system also of prime interest in the context of planetary studies. It is therefore of fundamental importance to tightly constrain the properties of the individual stellar components. We present a fully self-consistent, line-by-line differential abundance analysis of \u03b1 Cen AB based on high-quality HARPS data. Various line lists are used and analysis strategies implemented to improve the reliability of the results. Abundances of 21 species with a typical precision of 0.02\u20130.03 dex are reported. We find that the chemical composition of the two stars is not scaled solar (e.g. Na and Ni excess, depletion of neutron-capture elements), but that their patterns are strikingly similar, with a mean abundance difference (A \u2013 B) with respect to hydrogen of \u20130.01 \u00b1 0.04 dex. Much of the scatter may be ascribed to physical effects that are not fully removed through a differential analysis because of the mismatch in parameters between the two components. We derive an age for the system from abundance indicators (e.g. [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]) that is slightly larger than solar and in agreement with most asteroseismic results. Assuming coeval formation for the three components belonging to the system, this implies an age of about ~6 Gyrs for the M dwarf hosting the terrestrial planet Proxima Cen b. After correction for Galactic chemical evolution effects, we find a trend between the abundance ratios and condensation temperature in \u03b1 Cen A akin to that of the Sun. However, taking this finding as evidence for the sequestration of rocky material locked up in planets may be premature given that a clear link between the two phenomena remains to be established. The similarity between the abundance pattern of the binary components argues against the swallowing of a massive planet by one of the stars after the convective zones have shrunk to their present-day sizes.",
"Magnetic flux ropes are characterized by coherently twisted magnetic field lines, which are ubiquitous in magnetized plasmas. As the core structure of various eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere, flux ropes hold the key to understanding the physical mechanisms of solar eruptions, which impact the heliosphere and planetary atmospheres. The strong\u00e9st disturbances in the Earth\u2019s space environments are often associated with large-scale flux ropes from the Sun colliding with the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, leading to adverse, sometimes catastrophic, space-weather effects. However, it remains elusive as to how a flux rope forms and evolves toward eruption, and how it is structured and embedded in the ambient field. The present paper addresses these important questions by reviewing current understandings of coronal flux ropes from an observer\u2019s perspective, with an emphasis on their structures and nascent evolution toward solar eruptions, as achieved by combining observations of both remote sensing and in-situ detection with modeling and simulation. This paper highlights an initiation mechanism for coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in which plasmoids in current sheets coalesce into a \u2018seed\u2019 flux rope whose subsequent evolution into a CME is consistent with the standard model, thereby bridging the gap between microscale and macroscale dynamics.",
"Context. Short-period giant planets (P\u2272 10 days,Mp>0.1MJ) are frequently found to be solitary compared to other classes of exo-planets. Small inner companions to giant planets withP\u2272 15 days are known only in five compact systems: WASP-47, Kepler-730, WASP-132, TOI-1130, and TOI-2000. Here, we report the confirmation of TOI-5398, the youngest known compact multi-planet system composed of a hot sub-Neptune (TOI-5398 c,Pc= 4.77271 days) orbiting interior to a short-period Saturn (TOI-5398 b,Pb= 10.590547 days) planet, both transiting around a 650 \u00b1 150 Myr G-type star.Aims. As part of the Global Architecture of Planetary Systems (GAPS) Young Object project, we confirmed and characterised this compact system, measuring the radius and mass of both planets, thus constraining their bulk composition.Methods. Using multi-dimensional Gaussian processes, we simultaneously modelled stellar activity and planetary signals from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 48 light curve and our High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS-N) radial velocity (RV) time series. We confirmed the planetary nature of both planets, TOI-5398 b and TOI-5398 c, and obtained a precise estimation of their stellar parameters.Results. Through the use of astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic observations, our findings indicate that TOI-5398 is a young, active G dwarf star (650 \u00b1 150 Myr) with a rotational period ofProt= 7.34 days. The transit photometry and RV measurements enabled us to measure both the radius and mass of planets b,Rb= 10.30 \u00b1 0.40R\u2295,Mb= 58.7 \u00b1 5.7M\u2295, and c,Rc= 3.52 \u00b1 0.19R\u2295,Mc= 11.8 \u00b1 4.8M\u2295. TESS observed TOI-5398 during sector 48 and no further observations are planned in the current Extended Mission, making our ground-based light curves crucial for improvement of the ephemeris. With a transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) value of around 300, TOI-5398 b is the most amenable warm giant (10 <P< 100 days) for JWST atmospheric characterisation.",
"Context.Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are divided into slow and fast rotators (FRs and SRs) according to the degree of ordered rotation of their stellar populations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicate that galaxies form as FRs before their rotational support decreases, usually because of mergers.Aims.We aimed to investigate this process observationally for galaxies outside of clusters.Methods.We made use of the fact that different merger types leave different traces that have different lifetimes. We statistically analyzed multiple characteristics of galaxies that are expected to be influenced by mergers, such as tidal features, kinematically distinct cores, and stellar ages. They were taken from the MATLAS and ATLAS3Ddatabases. Through multilinear regression we identified the quantities that, at a fixed mass and environmental density of the galaxy, significantly correlate with a measure of the ordered rotation of the galaxy,\u03bbReN.Results.We found a negative correlation of the rotational support with the occurrence of tidal disturbances and kinematic substructures, and a positive correlation with metallicity and metallicity gradients. For massive galaxies, the rotational support correlates negatively with the abundance of\u03b1-elements, and for the galaxies in low-density environments, it correlates negatively with the central photometric cuspiness. These and additional literature observational constraints are explained the easiest if the mergers that decreased the rotational support of ETGs were typically minor, wet, and happening atz\u2004\u2248\u20042. They did not form the currently observed tidal features. The observed frequency of tidal features implies a merging rate of 0.07\u20130.2 per Gyr. This is insufficient to explain the observed growth of the radii of ETGs with redshift by mergers.",
"The identity of dark matter is a question of central importance in both astrophysics and particle physics. In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. I then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, I critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.",

"Our current knowledge of the star-forming metallicity of galaxies relies primarily on gas-phase oxygen abundance measurements. However, these do not always allow an accurate description of differences in stellar evolution and feedback, which are driven by variations in iron abundance. \u03b1-elements (such as oxygen) and iron are produced by sources that operate on different timescales and the link between them is not straightforward. We explore the origin of the [O/Fe]\u2013specific SFR (sSFR) relation, linking chemical abundances to galaxy formation timescales. This relation is adhered to by star-forming galaxies across redshifts according to cosmological simulations and basic theoretical expectations. Its apparent universality makes it suitable for trading the readily available oxygen for iron abundance. We show that the relation is determined by the relative iron production efficiency of core-collapse and type Ia supernovae and the delay-time distribution of the latter \u2013 uncertain factors that could be constrained empirically with the [O/Fe]\u2013sSFR relation. We compile and homogenise a literature sample of star-forming galaxies with observational iron abundance determinations to place first constraints on the [O/Fe]\u2013sSFR relation over a wide range of sSFR. The relation shows a clear evolution towards lower [O/Fe] with decreasing sSFR and a flattening above log10(sSFR/yr)\u2006\u2004>\u2004\u2006\u2005\u2212\u20059. These results are broadly consistent with expectations, but better constraints are needed to inform the models. We independently derive the relation from old Milky Way stars and find remarkable agreement between the two, as long as the recombination-line absolute oxygen abundance scale is used in conjunction with stellar metallicity measurements.",

"The PASSAGES (Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts) collaboration has recently defined a sample of 30 gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These rare, submillimeter-selected objects enable high-resolution views of the most extreme sites of star formation in galaxies at cosmic noon. Here, we present the first major compilation of strong lensing analyses using lenstool for PASSAGES, including 15 objects spanning z = 1.1\u20133.3, using complementary information from 0.\u20336-resolution 1.1 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and 0.\u20334 5 cm Jansky Very Large Array continuum imaging, in tandem with 1.6 \u03bcm Hubble and optical imaging with Gemini-S. Magnifications range from \u03bc = 2 to 28 (median \u03bc = 7), yielding intrinsic infrared luminosities of L\nIR = 0.2\u20135.9 \u00d7 1013\nL\n\u2299 (median 1.4 \u00d7 1013\nL\n\u2299) and inferred star formation rates of 170\u20136300 M\n\u2299 yr\u22121 (median 1500 M\n\u2299 yr\u22121). These results suggest that the PASSAGES objects comprise some of the most extreme known starbursts, rivaling the luminosities of even the brightest unlensed objects, further amplified by lensing. The intrinsic sizes of far-infrared continuum regions are large (R\ne = 1.7\u20134.3 kpc; median 3.0 kpc) but consistent with L\nIR\u2013R\ne scaling relations for z > 1 DSFGs, suggesting a widespread spatial distribution of star formation. With modestly high angular resolution, we explore if these objects might be maximal starbursts. Instead of approaching Eddington-limited surface densities, above which radiation pressure will disrupt further star formation, they are safely sub-Eddington\u2014at least on global, galaxy-integrated scales.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Because calibrated light curves of type Ia supernovae have become a major tool to determine the local expansion rate of the universe and also its geometrical structure, considerable attention has been given to models of these events over the past couple of years. There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, [Formula: see text], and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.",
"Jupiter has the most complex and energetic radiation belts in our Solar System and one of the most challenging space environments to measure and characterize in-depth. Their hazardous environment is also a reason why so many spacecraft avoid flying directly through their most intense regions, thus explaining how Jupiter\u2019s radiation belts have kept many of their secrets so well hidden, despite having been studied for decades. In this paper we argue why these secrets are worth unveiling. Jupiter\u2019s radiation belts and the vast magnetosphere that encloses them constitute an unprecedented physical laboratory, suitable for interdisciplinary and novel scientific investigations: from studying fundamental high energy plasma physics processes which operate throughout the Universe, such as adiabatic charged particle acceleration and nonlinear wave-particle interactions, to exploiting the astrobiological consequences of energetic particle radiation. The in-situ exploration of the uninviting environment of Jupiter\u2019s radiation belts presents us with many challenges in mission design, science planning, instrumentation, and technology. We address these challenges by reviewing the different options that exist for direct and indirect observations of this unique system. We stress the need for new instruments, the value of synergistic Earth and Jupiter-based remote sensing and in-situ investigations, and the vital importance of multi-spacecraft in-situ measurements. While simultaneous, multi-point in-situ observations have long become the standard for exploring electromagnetic interactions in the inner Solar System, they have never taken place at Jupiter or any strongly magnetized planet besides Earth. We conclude that a dedicated multi-spacecraft mission to Jupiter is an essential and obvious way forward for exploring the planet\u2019s radiation belts. Besides guaranteeing numerous discoveries and huge leaps in our understanding of radiation belt systems, such a mission would also enable us to view Jupiter, its extended magnetosphere, moons, and rings under new light, with great benefits for space, planetary, and astrophysical sciences. For all these reasons, in-situ investigations of Jupiter\u2019s radiation belts deserve to be given a high priority in the future exploration of our Solar System. This article is based on a White Paper submitted in response to the European Space Agency\u2019s call for science themes for its Voyage 2050 programme.",
"Context. The SPT0311\u201358 system resides in a massive dark-matter halo at z\u2004\u223c\u20046.9. It hosts two dusty galaxies (E and W) with a combined star formation rate (SFR) of \u223c3500 M\u2299 yr\u22121, mostly obscured and identified by the rest-frame IR emission. The surrounding field exhibits an overdensity of submillimetre sources, making it a candidate protocluster.Aims. Our main goal is to characterise the environment and the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) within this unique system.Methods. We used spatially resolved low-resolution (R\u2004=\u2004100) and high-resolution (R\u2004=\u20042700) spectroscopy provided by the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit to probe a field of \u223c17 \u00d7 17 kpc2 around this object, with a spatial resolution of \u223c0.5 kpc.Results. These observations reveal ten new galaxies at z\u2004\u223c\u20046.9 characterised by dynamical masses spanning from \u223c109 to 1010\u2006M\u2299 and a range in radial velocity of \u223c1500 km s\u22121, in addition to the already known E and W galaxies. The implied large number density (\u03d5\u2004\u223c\u2004104 Mpc\u22123) and the wide spread in velocities confirm that SPT0311\u201358 is at the core of a protocluster immersed in a very massive dark-matter halo of \u223c(5 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 1012 M\u2299, and therefore represents the most massive protocluster ever found at the epoch of reionisation (EoR). We also studied the dynamical stage of its core and find that it is likely not fully virialised. The galaxies in the system exhibit a wide range of properties and evolutionary stages. The contribution of the ongoing H\u03b1-based unobscured SFR to the total star formation (SF) varies significantly across the galaxies in the system. Their ionisation conditions range from those typical of the field galaxies at similar redshift recently studied with JWST to those found in more evolved objects at lower redshift, with log([OIII]/H\u03b2) varying from \u223c0.25 to 1. The metallicity spans more than 0.8 dex across the FoV, reaching nearly solar values in some cases. The detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy of the E galaxy reveals that it is actively assembling its stellar mass, showing inhomogeneities in the ISM properties at subkiloparsec scales, and a metallicity gradient (\u223c0.1 dex kpc\u22121) that can be explained by accretion of low metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium. The kinematic maps also depict an unsettled disc characterised by deviations from regular rotation, elevated turbulence, and indications of a possible precollision minor merger.Conclusions. These JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations confirm that SPT0311\u201358 is at the core of an extraordinary protocluster, and reveal details of its dynamical properties. They also unveil and provide insights into the diverse properties and evolutionary stages of the galaxies residing in this unique environment.",
"Context. Lyman \u03b1 blobs (LABs) are large-scale radio-quiet Lyman \u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) nebula at high-z that occur predominantly in overdense proto-cluster regions. In particular, there is the prototypical SSA22a-LAB1 at z\u2004=\u20043.1, which has become an observational reference for LABs across the electromagnetic spectrum.Aims. We want to understand the powering mechanisms that drive the LAB so that we may gain empirical insights into the galaxy-formation processes within a rare dense environment at high-z. Thus, we need to infer the distribution, the dynamics, and the ionisation state of LAB 1\u2019s Ly\u03b1 emitting gas.Methods. LAB 1 was observed for 17.2 h with the VLT/MUSE integral-field spectrograph. We produced optimally extracted narrow band images, in Ly\u03b1\u03bb1216, He\u202fII\u03bb1640, and we tried to detect C\u202fIV\u03bb1549 emission. By utilising a moment-based analysis, we mapped the kinematics and the line profile characteristics of the blob. We also linked the inferences from the line profile analysis to previous results from imaging polarimetry.Results. We map Ly\u03b1 emission from the blob down to surface-brightness limits of \u22486\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u221219 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122. At this depth, we reveal a bridge between LAB 1 and its northern neighbour LAB 8, as well as a shell-like filament towards the south of LAB 1. The complexity and morphology of the Ly\u03b1 profile vary strongly throughout the blob. Despite the complexity, we find a coherent large-scale east-west velocity gradient of \u223c1000 km s\u22121 that is aligned perpendicular to the major axis of the blob. Moreover, we observe a negative correlation of Ly\u03b1 polarisation fraction with Ly\u03b1 line width and a positive correlation with absolute line-of-sight velocity. Finally, we reveal He\u202fII emission in three distinct regions within the blob, however, we can only provide upper limits for C\u202fIV.Conclusions. Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: ionising radiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while Ly\u03b1 scattering contributes at larger distances. However, He\u202fII/Ly\u03b1 ratios combined with upper limits on C\u202fIV/Ly\u03b1 are not able to discriminate between active galactic nucleus ionisation and feedback- driven shocks. The alignment of the angular momentum vector parallel to the morphological principal axis appears to be at odds with the predicted norm for high-mass halos, but this most likely reflects that LAB 1 resides at a node of multiple intersecting filaments of the cosmic web. LAB 1 can thus be thought of as a progenitor of a present-day massive elliptical within a galaxy cluster.",
" There has been an incredibly large investment in obtaining high-resolution stellar spectra for determining chemical abundances of stars. This information is crucial to answer fundamental questions in astronomy by constraining the formation and evolution scenarios of the Milky Way as well as the stars and planets residing in it.  We have just entered a new era, in which chemical abundances of FGK-type stars are being produced at industrial scales, and in which the observations, reduction, and analysis of the data are automatically performed by machines. Here, we review the latest human efforts to assess the accuracy and precision of such industrial abundances by providing insights into the steps and uncertainties associated with the process of determining stellar abundances.  We also provide a description of current and forthcoming spectroscopic surveys, focusing on their reported abundances and uncertainties. This allows us to identify which elements and spectral lines are best and why. Finally, we make a brief selection of main scientific questions the community is aiming to answer with abundances. \u25aa Uncertainties in abundances need to be disentangled into random and systematic components. \u25aa Precision can be increased by applying differential or data-driven methods based on accurate data. \u25aa High-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra provide fundamental data that can be used to calibrate lower-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra of millions of stars. \u25aa Different survey calibration strategies must agree on a common set of reference stars to create data products that are consistent. \u25aa Data products provided by individual groups must be published using standard formats to ensure straightforward applicability.

"The Ariel mission will observe spectroscopically around 1000 exoplanets to further characterise their atmospheres. For the mission to be as efficient as possible, a good knowledge of the planets\u2019 ephemerides is needed before its launch in 2028. While ephemerides for some planets are being refined on a per-case basis, an organised effort to collectively verify or update them when necessary does not exist. In this study, we introduce the ExoClock project, an open, integrated and interactive platform with the purpose of producing a confirmed list of ephemerides for the planets that will be observed by Ariel. The project has been developed in a manner to make the best use of all available resources: observations reported in the literature, observations from space instruments and, mainly, observations from ground-based telescopes, including both professional and amateur observatories. To facilitate inexperienced observers and at the same time achieve homogeneity in the results, we created data collection and validation protocols, educational material and easy to use interfaces, open to everyone. ExoClock was launched in September 2019 and now counts over 140 participants from more than 15 countries around the world. In this release, we report the results of observations obtained until the 15h of April 2020 for 120 Ariel candidate targets. In total, 632 observations were used to either verify or update the ephemerides of 84 planets. Additionally, we developed the Exoplanet Characterisation Catalogue (ECC), a catalogue built in a consistent way to assist the ephemeris refinement process. So far, the collaborative open framework of the ExoClock project has proven to be highly efficient in coordinating scientific efforts involving diverse audiences. Therefore, we believe that it is a paradigm that can be applied in the future for other research purposes, too.",
" \u25aa Abstract\u2002 Considerable progress has been made over the past decade in the study of the evolutionary trends of the population of galaxy clusters in the Universe. In this review we focus on observations in the X-ray band. X-ray surveys with the ROSAT satellite, supplemented by follow-up studies with ASCA and Beppo-SAX, have allowed an assessment of the evolution of the space density of clusters out to z \u2248 1 and the evolution of the physical properties of the intracluster medium out to z \u2248 0.5. With the advent of Chandra and Newton-XMM and their unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution, these studies have been extended beyond redshift unity and have revealed the complexity of the thermodynamical structure of clusters. The properties of the intracluster gas are significantly affected by nongravitational processes including star formation and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity. Convincing evidence has emerged for modest evolution of both the bulk of the X-ray cluster population and their thermodynamical properties since redshift unity. Such an observational scenario is consistent with hierarchical models of structure formation in a flat low-density universe with \u03a9m \u2243 0.3 and \u03c38 \u2243 0.7\u20130.8 for the normalization of the power spectrum. Basic methodologies for construction of X-ray\u2013selected cluster samples are reviewed, and implications of cluster evolution for cosmological models are discussed. ",
"We report the detection of the radio afterglow of a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 111005A at 5-345 GHz, including very long baseline interferometry observations with a positional error of 0.2 mas. The afterglow position is coincident with the disc of a galaxy ESO 58049 at z = 0.01326 (\u223c1\u2033 from its centre), which makes GRB 111005A the second-closest GRB known to date, after GRB 980425. The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less luminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously less luminous than those of cosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then experienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly to only two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SNe), despite deep near- and mid-infrared observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion, reaching \u223c20 times fainter than other SNe associated with GRBs. Moreover, we measured a twice-solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low y-ray and radio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity suggest that GRB 111005A represents a rare class of GRB that is different from typical core-collapse events. We modelled the spectral energy distribution of the GRB 111005A host finding that it is a moderately star-forming dwarf galaxy, similar to the host of GRB 980425. The existence of two local GRBs in such galaxies is still consistent with the hypothesis that the GRB rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density, but suggests that the GRB rate is biased towards low SFRs. Using the far-infrared detection of ESO 580-49, we conclude that the hosts of both GRBs 111005A and 980425 exhibit lower dust content than what would be expected from their stellar masses and optical colors.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Three cases for mixing not present in standard stellar models are presented: Light element depletion in low mass main-sequence stars, deep mixing in massive stars, and deep mixing in low mass giants. The review begins with the mixing indicators and the predictions of standard models. The observational evidence for anomalous mixing is then presented, followed by the physics of mixing outside the standard model. The status of theoretical models that include extra mixing is then examined.",
"Context. Low luminosity radio galaxies (LLRGs) typically reside in dense megaparsec-scale environments and are often associated with brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). They are an excellent tool to study the evolution of molecular gas reservoirs in giant ellipticals, even close to the active galactic nucleus.Aims. We investigate the role of dense megaparsec-scale environment in processing molecular gas in LLRGs in the cores of galaxy (proto-)clusters. To this aim we selected within the COSMOS and DES surveys a sample of five LLRGs at z\u2004=\u20040.4\u22122.6 that show evidence of ongoing star formation on the basis of their far-infrared (FIR) emission.Methods. We assembled and modeled the FIR-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the five radio sources to characterize their host galaxies in terms of stellar mass and star formation rate. We observed the LLRGs with the IRAM-30 m telescope to search for CO emission. We then searched for dense megaparsec-scale overdensities associated with the LLRGs using photometric redshifts of galaxies and the Poisson Probability Method, which we have upgraded using an approach based on the wavelet-transform (wPPM), to ultimately characterize the overdensity in the projected space and estimate the radio galaxy miscentering. Color-color and color-magnitude plots were then derived for the fiducial cluster members, selected using photometric redshifts.Results. Our IRAM-30 m observations yielded upper limits to the CO emission of the LLRGs, at z\u2004=\u20040.39, 0.61, 0.91, 0.97, and 2.6. For the most distant radio source, COSMOS-FRI 70 at z\u2004=\u20042.6, a hint of CO(7\u21926) emission is found at 2.2\u03c3. The upper limits found for the molecular gas content M(H2)/M\u22c6\u2004< \u20040.11, 0.09, 1.8, 1.5, and 0.29, respectively, and depletion time \u03c4dep\u2004\u2272\u2004(0.2\u22127) Gyr of the five LLRGs are overall consistent with the corresponding values of main sequence field galaxies. Our SED modeling implies large stellar-mass estimates in the range log(M\u22c6/M\u2299) = 10.9\u221211.5, typical for giant ellipticals. Both our wPPM analysis and the cross-matching of the LLRGs with existing cluster/group catalogs suggest that the megaparsec-scale overdensities around our LLRGs are rich (\u22721014\u2006M\u2299) groups and show a complex morphology. The color-color and color-magnitude plots suggest that the LLRGs are consistent with being star forming and on the high-luminosity tail of the red sequence. The present study thus increases the still limited statistics of distant cluster core galaxies with CO observations.Conclusions. The radio galaxies of this work are excellent targets for ALMA as well as next-generation telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 A large collective effort to study the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over the past decade has led to a number of fundamental results on radio-quiet AGN and blazars. In radio-quiet AGN, the ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole, whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The \u201caccretion disk plus wind\u201d model explains most of the variability (and other) data and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future investigations are outlined.In blazars, rapid variability at the highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the IR\u2013optical\u2013UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the low-frequency continuum via synchrotron and the high frequency continuum via inverse Compton scattering of soft photons. Identifying the dominant source of soft photons, which is at present unclear, will strongly constrain the jet physics.",
"We present the first weak-lensing mass calibration and X-ray scaling relations of galaxy clusters and groups selected in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) observed by Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA over a contiguous footprint with an area of \u2248140 deg2, using the three-year (S19A) weak-lensing data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. In this work, we study a sample of 434 optically confirmed galaxy clusters (and groups) at redshift 0.01 \u2272z \u22721.3 with a median of 0.35, of which 313 systems are uniformly covered by the HSC survey to enable the extraction of the weak-lensing shear observable. In a Bayesian population modeling, we perform a blind analysis for the weak-lensing mass calibration by simultaneously modeling the observed count rate\u03b7and the shear profileg+of individual clusters through the count-rate-to-mass-and-redshift (\u03b7-M500-z) relation and the weak-lensing-mass-to-mass-and-redshift (MWL-M500-z) relation, respectively, while accounting for the bias in these observables using simulation-based calibrations. As a result, the count-rate-inferred and lensing-calibrated cluster mass is obtained from the joint modeling of the scaling relations, as the ensemble mass spanning a range of 1013h-1M\u2299\u2272M500\u2272 1015h-1M\u2299with a median of \u22481014h-1M\u2299for the eFEDS sample. With the mass calibration, we further model the X-ray observable-to-mass-and-redshift relations, including the rest-frame soft-band and bolometric luminosity (LXandLb), the emission-weighted temperatureTX, the mass of intra-cluster mediumMg, and the mass proxyYX, which is the product ofTXandMg. Except forLXwith a steeper dependence on the cluster mass at a statistically significant level, we find that the other X-ray scaling relations all show a mass trend that is statistically consistent with the self-similar prediction at a level of \u22721.7\u03c3. Meanwhile, all these scaling relations show no significant deviation from the self-similarity in their redshift scaling. Moreover, no significant redshift-dependent mass trend is present. This work demonstrates the synergy between the eROSITA and HSC surveys in preparation for the forthcoming first-year eROSITA cluster cosmology.",
"More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical compactness, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took 50\u00a0years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another 50\u00a0years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to $$10^{10}$$\n\n10\n10\n\n times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques. Finally, we sketch where the path of exploration and inquiry may go on in the next decades.",
"Context.The characterization of exoplanets requires the reliable determination of the fundamental parameters of their host stars. Spectral fitting plays an important role in this process. For the majority of stellar parameters, matching synthetic spectra to the observations provides a robust and unique solution for the fundamental parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, abundances, radial and rotational velocities, among others.Aims.Here, we present a new software package for fitting high-resolution stellar spectra that is easy to use, available for common platforms, and free from commercial licenses. We call it PySME. It is based on the proven Spectroscopy Made Easy package, later referred to as IDL SME or \u201coriginal\u201d SME.Methods.The IDL (Interactive Data Language) part of the original SME code has been rewritten in Python, but we kept the efficient C++ and FORTRAN code responsible for molecular-ionization equilibrium, opacities, and spectral synthesis. In the process we updated some components of the optimization procedure to offer more flexibility and better analysis of the convergence. The result is a more modern package with the same functionality as the original SME.Results.We applied PySME to a few stars of different spectral types and compared the derived fundamental parameters with the results from IDL SME and other techniques. We show that PySME works at least as well as the original SME.",
"Context.During the process of star formation, the dense gas undergoes significant chemical evolution leading to the emergence of a rich variety of molecules associated with hot cores and hot corinos. However, the physical conditions and the chemical processes involved in this evolution are poorly constrained; the early phases of emerging hot cores in particular represent an unexplored territory.Aims.We provide here a full molecular inventory of a massive protostellar core that is proposed to represent a precursor of a hot core. We investigate the conditions for the molecular richness of hot cores.Methods.We performed an unbiased spectral survey towards the hot core precursor associated with clump G328.2551-0.5321 between 159 GHz and 374 GHz, covering the entire atmospheric windows at 2 mm, 1.2 mm, and 0.8 mm. To identify the spectral lines, we used rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modelling assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium.Results.We detected 39 species plus 26 isotopologues, and were able to distinguish a compact (~2\u2033), warm inner region with a temperature, T, of ~100 K, a colder, more extended envelope withT ~20 K, and the kinematic signatures of the accretion shocks that have previously been observed with ALMA. We associate most of the emission of the small molecules with the cold component of the envelope, while the molecular emission of the warm gas is enriched by complex organic molecules (COMs). We find a high abundance of S-bearing molecules in the cold gas phase, including the molecular ions HCS+and SO+. The abundance of sulphur-bearing species suggests a low sulphur depletion, with a factor of \u22651%, in contrast to low-mass protostars, where the sulphur depletion is found to be stronger. Similarly to other hot cores, the deuterium fractionation of small molecules is low, showing a significant difference compared to low-mass protostars. We find a low isotopic ratio in particular for12C/13C of ~30, and32S/34S of ~12, which are about two times lower than the values expected at the galactocentric distance of G328.2551-0.5321. We identify nine COMs (CH3OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3CHO, HC(O)NH2, CH3CN, C2H5CN, C2H3CN, and CH3SH) in the warm component of the envelope, four in the cold gas, and four towards the accretion shocks.Conclusions.The presence of numerous molecular ions and high abundance of sulphur-bearing species originating from the undisturbed gas may suggest a contribution from shocked gas at the outflow cavity walls. The molecular composition of the cold component of the envelope is rich in small molecules, while a high abundance in numerous species of COMs suggests an increasing molecular complexity towards the warmer regions. The molecular composition of the warm gas is similar to that of both hot cores and hot corinos, but the molecular abundances are closer to the values found towards hot corinos than to values found towards hot cores. Considering the compactness of the warm region and its moderate temperature, we suggest that thermal desorption has not been completed towards this object yet, representing an early phase of the emergence of hot cores.",
"Stars are among the most fundamental structures of our Universe. They comprise most of the baryonic and luminous mass of galaxies; synthesize heavy elements; and inject mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium. They are also home to the planets.

We review the various physical processes and theories that have been put forward as well as the numerical simulations that have been carried out to explain the origin of the stellar IMF. Key messages from this review include the following:\n\u25aaGravity and turbulence most likely determine the power-law, high-mass part of the IMF.\u25aaDepending of the Mach number and the density distribution, several regimes are possible, including \u0393IMF \u2243 0, \u22120.8, \u22121, or \u22121.3, where dN/d log M \u221d M\n                        \u0393IMF\n                        . These regimes are likely universal; however, the transition between these regimes is not.\u25aaProtostellar jets can play a regulating influence on the IMF by injecting momentum into collapsing clumps and unbinding gas.\u25aaThe peak of the IMF may be a consequence of dust opacity and molecular hydrogen physics at the origin of the first hydrostatic core. This depends weakly on large-scale environmental conditions such as radiation, magnetic field, turbulence, or metallicity. This likely constitutes one reason for the relative universality of the IMF.\n            ",
"Context. Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are simple in the most basic model, but can show many complex features. The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the longest GRBs ever detected, also has the best-monitored afterglow in this rare class of GRBs.Aims. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical GRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield significant clues.Methods. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by multi-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws, and we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another ultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of the host galaxy.Results. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at \u22480.8 days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this, the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9 days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be exceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic rebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and are not unique.Conclusions. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow parameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that of classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A resulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The discovery of counterparts in X-ray and optical to radio wavelengths has revolutionized the study of \u03b3-ray bursts, until recently the most enigmatic of astrophysical phenomena. We now know that \u03b3-ray bursts are the biggest explosions in nature, caused by the ejection of ultrarelativistic matter from a powerful energy source and its subsequent collision with its environment. We have just begun to uncover a connection between supernovae and \u03b3-ray bursts, and are finally constraining the properties of the ultimate source of \u03b3-ray burst energy. We review here the observations that have led to this breakthrough in the field; we describe the basic theory of the fireball model and discuss the theoretical understanding that has been gained from interpreting the new wealth of data on \u03b3-ray bursts.",
"On August 17, 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two\u223c30 M\u2299 black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of \u223c100\u00a0s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short gamma-ray burst was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal Galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of \u223c10\u00a0days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This article revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.",
"Context.The chemical composition of the Sun is a fundamental yardstick in astronomy, relative to which essentially all cosmic objects are referenced. As such, having accurate knowledge of the solar elemental abundances is crucial for an extremely broad range of topics.Aims.We reassess the solar abundances of all 83 long-lived elements, using highly realistic solar modelling and state-of-the-art spectroscopic analysis techniques coupled with the best available atomic data and observations.Methods.The basis for our solar spectroscopic analysis is a three-dimensional (3D) radiative-hydrodynamical model of the solar surface convection and atmosphere, which reproduces the full arsenal of key observational diagnostics. New complete and comprehensive 3D spectral line formation calculations taking into account of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) are presented for Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Fe using comprehensive model atoms with reliable radiative and collisional data. Our newly derived abundances for C, N, and O are based on a 3D non-LTE analysis of permitted and forbidden atomic lines as well as 3D LTE calculations for a total of 879 molecular transitions of CH, C2, CO, NH, CN, and OH. Previous 3D-based calculations for another 50 elements are re-evaluated based on updated atomic data, a stringent selection of lines, improved consideration of blends, and new non-LTE calculations available in the literature. For elements where spectroscopic determinations of the quiet Sun are not possible, the recommended solar abundances are revisited based on complementary methods, including helioseismology (He), solar wind data from the Genesis sample return mission (noble gases), sunspot observations (four elements), and measurements of the most primitive meteorites (15 elements).Results.Our new improved analysis confirms the relatively low solar abundances of C, N, and O obtained in our previous 3D-based studies: log\u03f5C\u2004=\u20048.46\u2005\u00b1\u20050.04, log\u03f5N\u2004=\u20047.83\u2005\u00b1\u20050.07, and log\u03f5O\u2004=\u20048.69\u2005\u00b1\u20050.04. Excellent agreement between all available atomic and molecular indicators is achieved for C and O, but for N the atomic lines imply a lower abundance than for the molecular transitions for unknown reasons. The revised solar abundances for the other elements also typically agree well with our previously recommended values, with only Li, F, Ne, Mg, Cl, Kr, Rb, Rh, Ba, W, Ir, and Pb differing by more than 0.05 dex. The here-advocated present-day photospheric metal mass fraction is only slightly higher than our previous value, mainly due to the revised Ne abundance from Genesis solar wind measurements:Xsurface\u2004=\u20040.7438\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0054,Ysurface\u2004=\u20040.2423\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0054,Zsurface\u2004=\u20040.0139\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0006, andZsurface/Xsurface\u2004=\u20040.0187\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0009. Overall, the solar abundances agree well with those of CI chondritic meteorites, but we identify a correlation with condensation temperature such that moderately volatile elements are enhanced by \u22480.04 dex in the CI chondrites and refractory elements possibly depleted by \u22480.02 dex, conflicting with conventional wisdom of the past half-century. Instead, the solar chemical composition more closely resembles that of the fine-grained matrix of CM chondrites with the expected exception of the highly volatile elements.Conclusions.Updated present-day solar photospheric and proto-solar abundances are presented for 83 elements, including for all long-lived isotopes. The so-called solar modelling problem \u2013 a persistent discrepancy between helioseismology and solar interior models constructed with a low solar metallicity similar to that advocated here \u2013 remains intact with our revised solar abundances, suggesting shortcomings with the computed opacities and/or treatment of mixing below the convection zone in existing standard solar models. The uncovered trend between the solar and CI chondritic abundances with condensation temperature is not yet understood but is likely imprinted by planet formation, especially since a similar trend of opposite sign is observed between the Sun and solar twins.",
" The atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls the spectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling over time. Although the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades of experience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctive characteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling. In particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres, molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption lines or more), multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemical processes all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort. This review describes the process of incorporating these complexities into one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of substellar objects. We discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to model the physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant to understanding these atmospheres. The review focuses on methods for creating atmosphere models and briefly presents some comparisons of model predictions to data. Current challenges in the field and some comments on the future conclude the review. ",
"Context.While some galactic bars show recent massive star formation (SF) along them, some others do not. Whether bars with low level of SF are a consequence of low star formation efficiency, low gas inflow rate, or dynamical effects remains a matter of debate.Aims.In order to study the physical conditions that enable or prevent SF, we perform a multi-wavelength analysis of 12 strongly barred galaxies with total stellar masses log10(M\u22c6/M\u2299)\u2208[10.2,\u200611], chosen to host different degrees of SF along the bar major axis without any prior condition on gas content. We observe the CO(1\u20130) and CO(2\u20131) emission within bars with the IRAM-30 m telescope (beam sizes of 1.7\u20133.9 kpc and 0.9\u20132.0 kpc, respectively; 7\u20138 pointings per galaxy on average).Methods.We estimated molecular gas masses (Mmol) from the CO(1\u20130) and CO(2\u20131) emissions. SF rates (SFRs) were calculated from GALEX near-ultraviolet (UV) and WISE 12 \u03bcm images within the beam-pointings, covering the full bar extent (SFRs were also derived from far-UV and 22 \u03bcm).Results.We detect molecular gas along the bars of all probed galaxies. Molecular gas and SFR surface densities span the ranges log10(\u03a3mol/[M\u2299pc\u22122]) \u2208 [0.4,2.4] and log10(\u03a3SFR/[M\u2299pc\u22121kpc\u22122]]) \u2208 [\u22123.25, \u22120.75], respectively. The star formation efficiency (SFE; i.e., SFR/Mmol) in bars varies between galaxies by up to an order of magnitude (SFE \u2208[0.1,\u20061.8] Gyr\u22121). On average, SFEs are roughly constant along bars. SFEs are not significantly different from the mean value in spiral galaxies reported in the literature (\u223c0.43 Gyr\u22121), regardless of whether we estimateMmolfrom CO(1\u20130) or CO(2\u20131). Interestingly, the higher the total stellar mass of the host galaxy, the lower the SFE within their bars. In particular, the two galaxies in our sample with the lowest SFE and \u03a3SFR(NGC 4548 and NGC 5850, SFE \u2272 0.25 Gyr\u22121, \u03a3SFR\u2004\u2272\u200410\u22122.25\u2006M\u2299yr\u22121kpc\u22122,M\u22c6\u2004\u2273\u20041010.7\u2006M\u2299) are also those hosting massive bulges and signs of past interactions with nearby companions.Conclusions.We present a statistical analysis of the SFE in bars for a sample of 12 galaxies. The SFE in strong bars is not systematically inhibited (either in the central, middle, or end parts of the bar). Both environmental and internal quenching are likely responsible for the lowest SFEs reported in this work.",
"Remote sensing observations suffer significant limitations when used to study the bulk atmospheric composition of the giant planets of our Solar System. This impacts our knowledge of the formation of these planets and the physics of their atmospheres. A remarkable example of the superiority of in situ probe measurements was illustrated by the exploration of Jupiter, where key measurements such as the determination of the noble gases\u2019 abundances and the precise measurement of the helium mixing ratio were only made available through in situ measurements by the Galileo probe. Here we describe the main scientific goals to be addressed by the future in situ exploration of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, placing the Galileo probe exploration of Jupiter in a broader context. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level would yield insight into two broad themes: i) the formation history of the giant planets and that of the Solar System, and ii) the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. The probe would descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics, with data returned to Earth using a Carrier Relay Spacecraft as a relay station. An atmospheric probe could represent a significant ESA contribution to a future NASA New Frontiers or flagship mission to be launched toward Saturn, Uranus, and/or Neptune.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 Astronomical studies in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band of the spectrum were dismissed during the early years of space astronomy as impossible, primarily because of the mistaken view that radiation in this band would be absorbed by the interstellar medium. Observations in the 1980s from sounding rockets and limited duration orbital spacecraft began to show the potential of this field and led to the deployment of two spacecraft devoted to EUV astronomy: the UK Wide Field Camera and the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer. The instrumentation in these missions, although quite limited in comparison with instrumentation in other fields of space astronomy, provided unique and far-reaching results. These included new information on solar system topics, stellar chromospheres and corona, white dwarf astrophysics, cataclysmic variables, the interstellar medium, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. We summarize these findings herein.",
"For the purpose of this talk, I define all those galaxies as normal whose nuclear regions are not known to be dominated by a compact source. Thus I will exclude N galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies, but include galaxies like M81 and M82 which have weak compact nuclei. My review is organized in three parts, (i) tracers of star formation, (ii) star formation in the nuclear regions of observed galaxies, and (iii) the theoretical attempts to interpret the observational material.",
"Jan Hendrik Oort hypothesized the existence of a distant cloud of cometary objects that orbit the Sun based on a spike in the reciprocal orbital separation at 1\u2215a\u00a0 \u2272 \u00a010\u22124au\u22121. The Oort cloud is the source of long-period comets, but has not been observed directly, and its origin remains theoretical. Theories on its origin evoke a sequence of events that have been tested individually but never as a consistent chronology. We present a chronology of the formation and early evolution of the Oort cloud, and test the sequence of events by simulating the formation process in subsequent amalgamated steps. These simulations start with the Solar System being born with planets and asteroids in a stellar cluster orbiting the Galactic center. Upon ejection from its birth environment, we continue to follow the evolution of the Solar System while it navigates the Galaxy as an isolated planetary system. We conclude that the range in semi-major axis between ~100 au and several ~103au still bears the signatures of the Sun being born in a \u22731000M\u2299pc\u22123star cluster, and that most of the outer Oort cloud formed after the Solar System was ejected. The ejection of the Solar System, we argue, happened between ~20 Myr and 50 Myr after its birth. Trailing and leading trails of asteroids and comets along the Sun\u2019s orbit in the Galactic potential are the by-product of the formation of the Oort cloud. These arms are composed of material that became unbound from the Solar System when the Oort cloud formed. Today, the bulk of the material in the Oort cloud (~70%) originates from the region in the circumstellar disk that was located between ~15 au and ~35 au, near the current location of the ice giants and the Centaur family of asteroids. According to our simulations, this population is eradicated if the ice-giant planets are born in orbital resonance. Planet migration or chaotic orbital reorganization occurring while the Solar System is still a cluster member is, according to our model, inconsistent with the presence of the Oort cloud. About half the inner Oort cloud, between 100 and 104au, and a quarter of the material in the outer Oort cloud, \u2273104au, could be non-native to the Solar System but was captured from free-floating debris in the cluster or from the circumstellar disks of other stars in the birth cluster. Characterizing this population will help us to reconstruct the history of the Solar System.",
"Context. The z\u2004\u223c\u20040.1 type-2 QSO J1430+1339, known as the \u201cTeacup\u201d, is a complex galaxy showing a loop of ionised gas \u223c10 kpc in diameter, co-spatial radio bubbles, a compact (\u223c1 kpc) jet, and outflow activity. Its closeness offers the opportunity to study in detail the intricate interplay between the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the material in and around the galaxy, both the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM).Aims. We characterise the spatially resolved properties and effects of the galactic ionised gas outflow and compare them with those of the radio jet and with theoretical predictions to infer its acceleration mechanism.Methods. We used VLT/MUSE optical integral field spectroscopic observations to obtain flux, kinematic, and excitation maps of the extended (up to \u223c100 kpc) ionised gas and to characterise the properties of stellar populations. We built radial profiles of the outflow properties as a function of distance from the active nucleus, from kiloparsec up to tens of kiloparsec scales, at \u223c1 kpc resolution.Results. We detect a velocity dispersion enhancement (\u2273300 km s\u22121) elongated over several kiloparsecs perpendicular to the radio jet, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) ionisation lobes, and the fast outflow, similar to what is found in other galaxies hosting compact, low-power jets, indicating that the jet strongly perturbs the host ISM during its passage. We observe a decreasing trend with distance from the nucleus for the outflow properties (mass outflow rate, kinetic rate, momentum rate). The mass outflow rate drops from around 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in the inner 1\u20132 kpc to \u22720.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at 30 kpc. The mass outflow rate of the ionised outflow is significantly higher (\u223c1\u20138 times) than the molecular one, in contrast with what is often quoted in AGN. Based on energetic and morphological arguments, the driver of the multi-phase outflow is likely a combination of AGN radiation and the jet, or AGN radiation pressure on dust alone. The outflow mass-loading factor is \u223c5\u201310 and the molecular gas depletion time due to the multi-phase outflow is \u2272108 yr, indicating that the outflow can significantly affect the star formation and the gas reservoir in the galaxy. However, the fraction of the ionised outflow that is able to escape the dark matter halo potential is likely negligible. We detect blue-coloured continuum emission co-spatial with the ionised gas loop. Here, stellar populations are younger (\u2272100\u2013150 Myr) than in the rest of the galaxy (\u223c0.5\u20131 Gyr). This constitutes possible evidence for star formation triggered at the edge of the bubble due to the compressing action of the jet and outflow (\u201cpositive feedback\u201d), as predicted by theory. All in all, the Teacup constitutes a rich system in which AGN feedback from outflows and jets, in both its negative and positive flavours, co-exist.",
"The European Space Agency\u2019sPlancksatellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy ofPlanck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter \u039bCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well,Planckmeasures five of the six parameters to better than 1% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (\u03b8*) now known to 0.03%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen byPlanck, the success of the \u039bCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. ThePlanckdata, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from thePlanckmission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.",

They have been used to determine the age of the galactic disk, several open clusters, and a globular cluster.

We also examine the role of white dwarfs as tracers of various stellar populations, both in terms of observational searches and theoretical models. ",
"We present new images and continuum spectral analysis for 14 resolved Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) selected from the 74 MHz Very Large Array Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux (VLSSr). We combine new integrated measurements from the VLSSr with, when available, flux densities extracted from the Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array Survey and measurements from the literature to generate improved integrated continuum spectra sampled from ~15 MHz to ~217 GHz. We present the VLSSr images. When possible we combine them with publicly available images at 1.4 GHz, to analyse the resolved morphology and spectral index distribution across each SNR. We interpret the results and look for evidence of thermal absorption caused by ionised gas either proximate to the SNR itself, or along its line of sight. Three of the SNRs, G4.5+6.8 (Kepler), G28.6\u22120.1, and G120.1+1.4 (Tycho), have integrated spectra which can be adequately fit with simple power laws. The resolved spectral index map forTychoconfirms internal absorption which was previously detected by the Low Frequency Array, but it is insufficient to affect the fit to the integrated spectrum. Two of the SNRs are pulsar wind nebulae, G21.5\u22120.9 and G130.7+3.1 (3C 58). For those we identify high-frequency spectral breaks at 38 and 12 GHz, respectively. For the integrated spectra of the remaining nine SNRs, a low frequency spectral turnover is necessary to adequately fit the data. In all cases we are able to explain the turnover by extrinsic thermal absorption. For G18.8+0.3 (Kes 67), G21.8\u22120.6 (Kes 69), G29.7\u22120.3 (Kes 75), and G41.1\u22120.3 (3C 397), we attribute the absorption to ionised gas along the line of sight, possibly from extended H\u202fIIregion envelopes. For G23.3\u22120.3 (W41) the absorption can be attributed to H\u202fIIregions located in its immediate proximity. Thermal absorption from interactions at the ionised interface between SNR forward shocks and the surrounding medium were previously identified as responsible for the low frequency turnover in SNR G31.9+0.0 (3C 391); our integrated spectrum is consistent with the previous results. We present evidence for the same phenomenon in three additional SNRs G27.4+0.0 (Kes 73), G39.2\u20130.3 (3C 396), and G43.3\u20130.2 (W49B), and derive constraints on the physical properties of the interaction. This result indicates that interactions between SNRs and their environs should be readily detectable through thermal absorption by future low frequency observations of SNRs with improved sensitivity and resolution.",
"Aims.We perform a homogeneous analysis of an unprecedented set of spatially resolved scaling relations (SRs) between interstellar medium (ISM) components, that is to say dust, gas, and gas-phase metallicity, and other galaxy properties, such as stellar mass (Mstar), total baryonic content, and star-formation rate (SFR), in a range of physical scales between 0.3 and 3.4 kpc. We also study some ratios between galaxy components: dust-to-stellar, dust-to-gas, and dust-to-metal ratios.Methods.We use a sample of 18 large, spiral, face-on DustPedia galaxies. The sample consists of galaxies with spatially resolved dust maps corresponding to 15Herschel-SPIRE 500 \u03bcm resolution elements across the optical radius, with the morphological stage spanning fromT\u2004=\u2004 2 to 8,Mstarfrom 2\u2005\u00d7\u2005109to 1\u2005\u00d7\u20051011M\u2299, SFR from 0.2 to 13M\u2299yr\u22121, and oxygen abundance from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.3 to 8.8.Results.All the SRs are moderate or strong correlations except the dust-H\u202fISR that does not exist or is weak for most galaxies. The SRs do not have a universal form but each galaxy is characterized by distinct correlations, affected by local processes and galaxy peculiarities. The SRs hold, on average, starting from the scale of 0.3 kpc, and if a breaking down scale exists it is below 0.3 kpc. By evaluating all galaxies together at the common scale of 3.4 kpc, differences due to peculiarities of individual galaxies are cancelled out and the corresponding SRs are consistent with those of whole galaxies. By comparing subgalactic and global scales, the most striking result emerges from the SRs involving ISM components: the dust-total gas SR is a good correlation at all scales, while the dust-H2and dust-H\u202fISRs are good correlations at subkiloparsec/kiloparsec and total scales, respectively. For the other explored SRs, there is a good agreement between small and global scales and this may support the picture where the main physical processes regulating the properties and evolution of galaxies occur locally. In this scenario, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of self-regulation of the star-formation process. The analysis of subgalactic ratios between galaxy components shows that they are consistent with those derived for whole galaxies, from low to high redshift, supporting the idea that also these ratios could be set by local processes.Conclusions.Our results highlight the heterogeneity of galaxy properties and the importance of resolved studies on local galaxies in the context of galaxy evolution. They also provide fundamental observational constraints to theoretical models and updated references for high-redshift studies.",
"Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report high angular-resolution observations of the redshift z\u2006\u2004=\u20043.63 galaxy H-ATLAS J083051.0+013224 (G09v1.97), one of the most luminous strongly lensed galaxies discovered by the Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). We present 0.\u20332\u22120.\u20334 resolution images of the rest-frame 188 and 419\u2006\u03bcm dust continuum and the CO(6\u20135), H2O(211\u2212202), and Jup\u2004=\u20042\u2006H2O+ line emission. We also report the detection of H2O(211\u2212202) in this source. The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete \u223c1.\u20335 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center, which is caused by a special dual deflector lensing configuration. The observed line profiles of the CO(6\u20135), H2O(211\u2212202), and Jup\u2004=\u20042\u2006H2O+ lines are strikingly similar. In the source plane, we reconstruct the dust continuum images and the spectral cubes of the CO, H2O, and H2O+ line emission at sub-kiloparsec scales. The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7\u2005\u00b1\u20050.1 kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is \u03bc\u2004\u223c\u200410\u221211, the magnification of the line emission varies from 5 to 22 across different velocity components. The line emission of CO(6\u20135), H2O(211\u2212202), and H2O+ have similar spatial and kinematic distributions. The molecular gas and dust content reveal that G09v1.97 is a gas-rich major merger in its pre-coalescence phase, with a total molecular gas mass of \u223c1011\u2006M\u2299. Both of the merging companions are intrinsically ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with infrared luminosities LIR reaching \u22734\u2005\u00d7\u20051012\u2006L\u2299, and the total LIR of G09v1.97 is (1.4\u2005\u00b1\u20050.7)\u00d71013\u2006L\u2299. The approaching southern galaxy (dominating from V\u2004=\u2004\u2212400 to \u2212150 km s\u22121 relative to the systemic velocity) shows no obvious kinematic structure with a semi-major half-light radius of as\u2004=\u20040.4 kpc, while the receding galaxy (0 to 350 km s\u22121) resembles an as\u2004=\u20041.2 kpc rotating disk. The two galaxies are separated by a projected distance of 1.3 kpc, bridged by weak line emission (\u2212150 to 0 km s\u22121) that is co-spatially located with the cold dust emission peak, suggesting a large amount of cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the interacting region. As one of the most luminous star-forming dusty high-redshift galaxies, G09v1.97 is an exceptional source for understanding the ISM in gas-rich starbursting major merging systems at high redshift.",
"Astronomy does not often appear in the socio-political and economic history of nineteenthcentury Britain. Whereas contemporary literature, poetry and the visual arts made significant reference to the heavens, the more earthbound arena of finance seems an improbable place to encounter astronomical themes. This paper shows that astronomical practice was an important factor in the emergence of what can be described as an accountant's view of the world. I begin by exploring the senses of the term \u2018calculation\u2019 in Regency England, and then seek to reveal how the dramatic growth of vigilance in science, the organization and control of labour, and the monitoring of society and the economy drew upon and informed this disciplined numerical technique. Observations in all these areas could only be trusted if correctly reduced through a single system of calculation assisted by a group of standardized tables and division of mental labour. Within this setting the stellar economy provided an object that was seemingly ordered and law-like and therefore predictable through a powerful combination of techniques.",
"Icy bodies with subsurface oceans are a prime target for astrobiology investigations, with an increasing number of scientists participating in the planning, development, and realization of space missions to these worlds. Within Germany, the Ocean Worlds and Icy Moons working group of the German Astrobiology Society provides an invaluable platform for scientists and engineers from universities and other organizations with a passion for icy ocean worlds to share knowledge and start collaborations. We here present an overview about astrobiology research activities related to icy ocean worlds conducted either in Germany or in strong collaboration with scientists in Germany. With recent developments, Germany offers itself as a partner to contribute to icy ocean world missions.",
"Context. Understanding the initial properties of star forming material and how they affect the star formation process is a key question. The infalling gas must redistribute most of its initial angular momentum inherited from prestellar cores before reaching the central stellar embryo. Disk formation has been naturally considered as a possible solution to this \u201cangular momentum problem\u201d. However, how the initial angular momentum of protostellar cores is distributed and evolves during the main accretion phase and the beginning of disk formation has largely remained unconstrained up to now.Aims. In the framework of the IRAM CALYPSO survey, we obtained observations of the dense gas kinematics that we used to quantify the amount and distribution of specific angular momentum at all scales in collapsing-rotating Class 0 protostellar envelopes.Methods. We used the high dynamic range C18O (2\u22121) and N2H+ (1\u22120) datasets to produce centroid velocity maps and probe the rotational motions in the sample of 12 envelopes from scales ~50 to ~5000 au.Results. We identify differential rotation motions at scales \u22721600 au in 11 out of the 12 protostellar envelopes of our sample by measuring the velocity gradient along the equatorial axis, which we fit with a power-law model v \u221d r\u03b1. This suggests that coherent motions dominate the kinematics in the inner protostellar envelopes. The radial distributions of specific angular momentum in the CALYPSO sample suggest the following two distinct regimes within protostellar envelopes: the specific angular momentum decreases as j \u221d r1.6\u00b10.2 down to ~1600 au and then tends to become relatively constant around ~6 \u00d7 10\u22124 km s\u22121 pc down to ~50 au.Conclusions. The values of specific angular momentum measured in the inner Class 0 envelopes suggest that material directly involved in the star formation process (<1600 au) has a specific angular momentum on the same order of magnitude as what is inferred in small T-Tauri disks. Thus, disk formation appears to be a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation during the collapse. Our analysis reveals a dispersion of the directions of velocity gradients at envelope scales >1600 au, suggesting that these gradients may not be directly related to rotational motions of the envelopes. We conclude that the specific angular momentum observed at these scales could find its origin in other mechanisms, such as core-forming motions (infall, turbulence), or trace an imprint of the initial conditions for the formation of protostellar cores.",
"Context. Recently, astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods of as low as 10 days. Contrary to wind-fed BH high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), no X-ray counterpart was detected, probably because of the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disc around the BH. Nevertheless, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute, and strongly magnetised plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.Methods. We used detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10\u201390 M\u2299 and orbital periods of 1\u20133000 d. We computed the X-ray luminosity for a broad range of radiative efficiencies that depend on the mass accretion rate and flow geometry.Results. For typical conditions around stellar-mass BHs, we show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts that at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) produce X-ray luminosities of above 1031 erg\u2006s\u22121, which are observable with focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses of above 2.3 M\u2299, which aligns well with our predictions and may be interesting sources for follow-up observations. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 104.5\u2005\u2212\u20055.5 L\u2299.Conclusions. These findings advocate for prolonged X-ray observations of the stellar-mass black hole candidates identified in the vicinity of OB stars. Such long exposures could reveal the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs and provide constraints for the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries and identify the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers.",
"The status of the absolute magnitude calibrations is reviewed for the long period Cepheids of population I and II, RR Lyrae stars, evolved \u201cabove horizontal branch\u201d (AHB1) variables (periods 0.8 to 3 days), dwarf Cepheids of both populations (the Delta Scuti and SX Phoenicus variables), and the anomalous Cepheids (AC). Evidence shows that the period-color and period-luminosity (P-L) relations for population I Cepheids in the Galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have different slopes and zero points. This greatly complicates use of Cepheids for the extragalactic distance scale. Strategies are discussed to patch the problem. A consensus exists for the long distance scale for RR Lyrae stars whose calibrations favor \u3008MV(RR)\u3009 = 0.52 at [Fe/H] = \u22121.5. Exceptions exist for \u201csecond parameter\u201d clusters where the variation of the morphology of the horizontal branch with metallicity is anomalous, the most blatant being NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The status and calibrations of ABH1 and AC show that different evolutionary paths and masses explain the difference P-L relations for them. AC appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters. AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters. The difference may be used to study the formation of the remote Galactic halo if it is partially made by tidal disruption of companion dwarf spheroidals.",
"\u25aa Abstract\u2002 The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the great outstanding problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step toward achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.",
"Fifty years of solar wind observations have provided extensive data that drives an evolving view of the fundamental nature and dynamics of the magnetic, velocity, and density fluctuations that are ubiquitous throughout the heliosphere. Despite the ongoing examination of ever improving data, fundamental questions remain unanswered because there are very few multi-point measurements from a sufficient number of spacecraft in close proximity to fully resolve the three-dimensional dynamics that are at the heart of the problem. Simulations provide new insights and new questions, but most simulations sacrifice one aspect of plasma physics in order to address another. Computers and computational methods remain insufficient to simulate fully compressive, fully nonlinear, collisionless plasma dynamics with sufficient spatial range and dimension to be considered a complete description of solar wind turbulence. For these reasons, there remain multiple divergent opinions as to the underlying dynamics of solar wind turbulence, dissipation, and the observed heating of the thermal plasma. We review observations of solar wind turbulence in so far as they contribute to an understanding of solar wind heating through the existence of energy reservoirs, the dynamics that move energy from the reservoirs to the dissipation scales, and the conversion into heat of energy associated with coherent fluctuations.",
"Deep optical spectroscopic surveys of galaxies provide a unique opportunity to investigate rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) emission line properties of galaxies atz\u2004\u223c\u20042\u2005\u2212\u20054.5. Here we combine VLT/MUSE Guaranteed Time Observations of theHubbleDeep Field South, Ultra Deep Field, COSMOS, and several quasar fields with other publicly available data from VLT/VIMOS and VLT/FORS2 to construct a catalogue of He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 emitters atz\u2004\u2273\u20042. The deepest areas of our MUSE pointings reach a 3\u03c3line flux limit of 3.1\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u221219erg s\u22121cm\u22122. After discarding broad-line active galactic nuclei, we find 13 He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 detections from MUSE with a medianMUV\u2004=\u2004\u221220.1 and 21 tentative He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 detections from other public surveys. Excluding Ly\u03b1, all except two galaxies in our sample show at least one other rest-UV emission line, with C\u202fIII]\u03bb1907,\u03bb1909 being the most prominent. We use multi-wavelength data available in theHubblelegacy fields to derive basic galaxy properties of our sample through spectral energy distribution fitting techniques. Taking advantage of the high-quality spectra obtained by MUSE (\u223c10\u2005\u2212\u200530 h of exposure time per pointing), we use photo-ionisation models to study the rest-UV emission line diagnostics of the He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 emitters. Line ratios of our sample can be reproduced by moderately sub-solar photo-ionisation models, however, we find that including effects of binary stars lead to degeneracies in most free parameters. Even after considering extra ionising photons produced by extreme sub-solar metallicity binary stellar models, photo-ionisation models are unable to reproduce rest-frame He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 equivalent widths (\u223c0.2\u2005\u2212\u200510 \u00c5), thus additional mechanisms are necessary in models to match the observed He\u202fII\u2004\u03bb1640 properties.",
" The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: \u25aa\u2002 Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. \u25aa\u2002 There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. \u25aa\u2002 Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes\u2014presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima\u2014broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks. The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.

"Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are sporadically ejected from the Sun during flares and coronal mass ejections. They are of major astrophysical interest, because the proximity of the Sun allows for detailed multi-messenger studies. They affect space weather due to interactions with electronics, with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and with humans if they leave the protective shield of the magnetosphere of the Earth. Since early studies in the 1950s, starting with particle detectors on the ground, SEP events have been related to radio bursts. Two subjects are addressed in this chapter: attempts to establish quantitative correlations between SEPs and microwave bursts produced by gyro synchrotron radiation of mildly relativistic electrons, and the information derived from type III radio bursts on impulsive processes of particle acceleration and the coronal and interplanetary propagation. Type III radio bursts produced by electron beams on open magnetic field lines have a wide range of applications, including the identification of acceleration regions, the identification of confined particle acceleration with coronal signatures, but no SEPs, and the paths that the electrons, and energetic charged particles in general, take to travel from the low corona to the Heliosphere in case they escape. Simple scenarios of coronal particle acceleration are confirmed in relatively simple and short events. But the comparison with particle transport models shows that longer and delayed acceleration episodes exist especially in large SEP events. They will be discussed in a companion chapter.",
"The spin of a black hole is an important quantity to study, providing a window into the processes by which a black hole was born and grew. Furthermore, spin can be a potent energy source for powering relativistic jets and energetic particle acceleration. In this review, I describe the techniques currently used to detect and measure the spins of black holes. It is shown that: \u25aa\u2002 Two well-understood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum fitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at moderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques allowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates. \u25aa\u2002 Many accreting supermassive black holes are found to be rapidly spinning, although a population of more slowly spinning black holes emerges at masses above [Formula: see text] as expected from recent structure formation models. \u25aa\u2002 Many accreting stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems are rapidly spinning and must have been born in this state. \u25aa\u2002 The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary black holes. Most of the premerger black holes are found to be slowly spinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger product. \u25aa\u2002 The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary and the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of formation mechanisms.Given the array of new electromagnetic and gravitational wave capabilities currently being planned, the future of black hole spin studies is bright.",
"Context. Massive Wolf\u2013Rayet (WR) stars dominate the radiative and mechanical energy budget of galaxies and probe a critical phase in the evolution of massive stars prior to core collapse. It is not known whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR; cWR) form predominantly through wind stripping (w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). Whereas spectroscopy of WR binaries has so-far largely been avoided because of its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries and binary candidates of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; metallicity Z\u2004\u2248\u20040.5\u2006Z\u2299), which were identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite spectra, or high X-ray luminosities.Aims. Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive stars at subsolar metallicity and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming these stars.Methods. Spectroscopy was performed using the Potsdam Wolf\u2013Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement was performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status was interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically homogeneous evolution.Results. Among our sample, 28/44 objects show composite spectra and are analyzed as such. An additional five targets show periodically moving WR primaries but no detected companions (SB1); two (BAT99 99 and 112) are potential WR + compact-object candidates owing to their high X-ray luminosities. We cannot confirm the binary nature of the remaining 11 candidates. About two-thirds of the WN components in binaries are identified as cWR, and one-third as hydrogen-burning WR stars. We establish metallicity-dependent mass-loss recipes, which broadly agree with those recently derived for single WN stars, and in which so-called WN3/O3 stars are clear outliers. We estimate that 45\u2006\u2005\u00b1\u2005\u200630% of the cWR stars in our sample have interacted with a companion via mass transfer. However, only \u224812\u2006\u2005\u00b1\u2005\u20067% of the cWR stars in our sample naively appear to have formed purely owing to stripping via a companion (12% b-WR). Assuming that apparently single WR stars truly formed as single stars, this comprises \u22484% of the whole LMC WN population, which is about ten times less than expected. No obvious differences in the properties of single and binary WN stars, whose luminosities extend down to log\u2006L\u2004\u2248\u20045.2\u2006[L\u2299], are apparent. With the exception of a few systems (BAT99 19, 49, and 103), the equatorial rotational velocities of the OB-type companions are moderate (veq\u2004\u2272\u2004250\u2006km\u2006s\u22121) and challenge standard formalisms of angular-momentum accretion. For most objects, chemically homogeneous evolution can be rejected for the secondary, but not for the WR progenitor.Conclusions. No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.",
"The corona is a layer of hot plasma that surrounds the Sun, traces out its complex magnetic field, and ultimately expands into interplanetary space as the supersonic solar wind. Although much has been learned in recent decades from advances in observations, theory, and computer simulations, we still have not identified definitively the physical processes that heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. In this review, we summarize these recent advances and speculate about what else is required to finally understand the fundamental physics of this complex system. Specifically: \u25aa We discuss recent subarcsecond observations of the corona, some of which appear to provide evidence for tangled and braided magnetic fields and some of which do not. \u25aa We review results from three-dimensional numerical simulations that, despite limitations in dynamic range, reliably contain sufficient heating to produce and maintain the corona. \u25aa We provide a new tabulation of scaling relations for a number of proposed coronal heating theories that involve waves, turbulence, braiding, nanoflares, and helicity conservation. An understanding of these processes is important not only for improving our ability to forecast hazardous space-weather events but also for establishing a baseline of knowledge about a well-resolved star that is relevant to other astrophysical systems.",
"Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have been extensively investigated in the Local Group, but their low luminosity and surface brightness make similar work in more distant galaxy groups challenging. Modern instrumentation unlocks the possibility of scrutinizing these faint systems in other environments, expanding the parameter space of group properties. We use MUSE spectroscopy to study the properties of 14 known or suspected dSph satellites of Cen A. Twelve targets are confirmed to be group members based on their radial velocities. Two targets are background galaxies at \u223c50 Mpc: KK 198 is a face-on spiral galaxy, and dw1315\u221245 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy with an effective radius of \u223c2300 pc. The 12 confirmed dSph members of the Cen A group have old and metal-poor stellar populations and follow the stellar metallicity-luminosity relation defined by the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. In the three brightest dwarf galaxies (KK 197, KKs 55, and KKs 58), we identify globular clusters, as well as a planetary nebula in KK 197, although its association with this galaxy and/or the extended halo of Cen A is uncertain. Using four discrete tracers, we measure the velocity dispersion and dynamical mass of KK 197. This dSph appears dark matter dominated and lies on the radial acceleration relation of star-forming galaxies within the uncertainties. It also is consistent with predictions stemming from modified Newtonian dynamics. Surprisingly, in the dwarf KK 203 we find an extended H\u03b1 ring. Careful examination of Hubble Space Telescope photometry reveals a very low level of star formation at ages between 30 and 300 Myr. The H\u03b1 emission is most likely linked to a \u223c40 Myr old supernova remnant, although other possibilities for its origin cannot be entirely ruled out.",
"We know little about the outermost exoplanets in planetary systems because our detection methods are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits. However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet population because dynamical modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing planets. We use four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178 debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH, and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys. Similar analyses are often conducted for individual discs, but we consider a large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the population of wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting these planets in the near future. We show that a \u2018typical\u2019 cold debris disc likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10\u2013100 au, with some needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently undetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should reveal many such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be perturbing debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred to be forming in protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed planets do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young planets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the responsible planets are more massive (and located farther inwards) than debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution modelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having unreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs. Finally, we provide catalogues of planet predictions and identify promising targets for future planet searches.",
"Aims. In this work we present the results of our analysis of 16 300 medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of late-type stars in the Kepler field with the aim of determining the stellar parameters, activity level, lithium atmospheric content, and binarity.Methods. We have used a version of the code rotfit specifically developed for the lamost medium-resolution spectra to determine stellar parameters via the adoption of a grid of spectra of real stars. We provide a catalog with the atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and projected rotation velocity (v sin i). For cool stars (Teff \u2264 6500 K), we also calculated the Ha and Li i\u03bb6708 equivalent width, which are important indicators of chromospheric activity and evolutionary stage, respectively.Results. From the sample of 16 300 spectra, we have derived the RV and atmospheric parameters for 14 300 spectra of 7443 stars. Literature data (mainly from high- or medium-resolution spectra) were used for a quality control of the results and to assess the accuracy of the derived parameters. The Teff and log g values are in good agreement with the literature, although their distribution displays some clustering effects, which may be the result of the nonuniform distribution of the templates in the parameter space. The most relevant differences are found for [Fe/H], which appears to be overestimated for metal-poor stars; this overestimation is also likely due to the template grid. We propose a relation to correct the [Fe/H] values derived with rotfit. We were able to identify interesting objects, such as double-lined binaries, stars with variable RVs, lithium-rich giants, and emission-line objects. Based on the H\u03b1 flux, we found 327 active stars. We were able to detect the Li i\u03bb6708 line and measure its equivalent width for 1657 stars, both giants and stars on the main sequence. Regarding the latter, we performed a discrete age classification based on the atmospheric lithium abundance and the upper envelopes of a few open clusters. Among the giants, we found 195 Li-rich stars, 161 of which are reported here for the first time. No relationship is found between stellar rotation and lithium abundance, which allows us to rule out merger scenarios as the predominant explanation of the enrichment of Li in our sample. The fraction of Li-rich giants, \u2248 4%, is higher than expected.",
"Context. The physics of magnetic hot stars and how a large-scale magnetic field affects their interior properties is largely unknown. Few studies have combined high-quality observations and modelling of magnetic pulsating stars, known as magneto-asteroseismology, primarily because of the dearth of detected pulsations in stars with a confirmed and well-characterised large-scale magnetic field.Aims. We aim to characterise observational signatures of rotation and pulsation in chemically peculiar candidate magnetic stars using photometry from the K2 space mission. Thus, we identify the best candidate targets for ground-based, optical spectropolarimetric follow-up observations to confirm the presence of a large-scale magnetic field.Methods. We employed customised reduction and detrending tools to process the K2 photometry into optimised light curves for a variability analysis. We searched for the periodic photometric signatures of rotational modulation caused by surface abundance inhomogeneities in 56 chemically peculiar A and B stars. Furthermore, we searched for intrinsic variability caused by pulsations (coherent or otherwise) in the amplitude spectra of these stars.Results. The rotation periods of 38 chemically peculiar stars are determined, 16 of which are the first determination of the rotation period in the literature. We confirm the discovery of high-overtone roAp pulsation modes in HD\u00a0177765 and find an additional 3 Ap and Bp stars that show evidence of high-overtone pressure modes found in roAp stars in the form of possible Nyquist alias frequencies in their amplitude spectra. Furthermore, we find 6 chemically peculiar stars that show evidence of intrinsic variability caused by gravity or pressure pulsation modes.Conclusions. The discovery of pulsations in a non-negligible fraction of chemically peculiar stars make these stars high-priority targets for spectropolarimetric campaigns to confirm the presence of their expected large-scale magnetic field. The ultimate goal is to perform magneto-asteroseismology and probe the interior physics of magnetic pulsating stars.",
"A large fraction of interstellar carbon is locked up in solid grains. The nature, origin and evolution of these grains have been investigated for decades. A combination of observations, models and experiments indicates that carbonaceous dust is mostly made of a mixture of grains composed almost exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. They have different proportions of aliphatic and aromatic structures, and a variable H/C ratio. Their sizes can vary typically between the nm and the hundreds of nm. Carbonaceous grains are largely formed in the envelopes of carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and evolve in the interstellar medium, where they can be transformed or destroyed by the effects of hydrogen atoms, UV radiation, cosmic rays or shock waves from supernovae. Surviving grains eventually enter dense clouds and participate in the cloud collapse leading to star formation, closing thus their lifecycle. Within this general picture, there are doubts and issues that cannot be solved just by observation and modeling and require laboratory work. In this article we provide an overview of the development and present state of the field indicating open problems and debated questions. We stress recent experimental progress in the understanding of dust formation, both in circumstellar envelopes and the cold interstellar medium, and also in the energetic processing of dust analogs, that points to a possible top down chemistry in the diffuse medium, and especially in photon irradiated regions.",
"We present the spectroscopic and photometric study of five intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs), namely AT 2010dn, AT 2012jc, AT 2013la, AT 2013lb, and AT 2018aes. They share common observational properties and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical ILRT SN 2008S. These events have a rise time that is less than 15 days and absolute peak magnitudes of between \u221211.5 and \u221214.5 mag. Their pseudo-bolometric light curves peak in the range 0.5\u20139.0\u2005\u00d7\u20051040\u2006erg\u2006s\u22121 and their total radiated energies are on the order of (0.3\u20133) \u00d7 1047 erg. After maximum brightness, the light curves show a monotonic decline or a plateau, resembling those of faint supernovae IIL or IIP, respectively. At late phases, the light curves flatten, roughly following the slope of the 56Co decay. If the late-time power source is indeed radioactive decay, these transients produce 56Ni masses on the order of 10\u22124 to 10\u22123\u2005M\u2299. The spectral energy distribution of our ILRT sample, extending from the optical to the mid-infrared (MIR) domain, reveals a clear IR excess soon after explosion and non-negligible MIR emission at very late phases. The spectra show prominent H lines in emission with a typical velocity of a few hundred km s\u22121, along with Ca II features. In particular, the [Ca\u202fII] \u03bb7291,7324 doublet is visible at all times, which is a characteristic feature for this family of transients. The identified progenitor of SN 2008S, which is luminous in archival Spitzer MIR images, suggests an intermediate-mass precursor star embedded in a dusty cocoon. We propose the explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star forming an electron-capture supernova as a plausible explanation for these events.",
"Context. Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in substructured young discs. Dense, hot, and high-pressure regions that formed during the gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas and dust interaction and resolve potential zones of dust concentration during star and disc formation stages.Aims. We explore whether the thermal and dynamical conditions that developed during protostellar disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport the well-coupled gas and dust components.Methods. We simulated the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We used a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry and followed the azimuthal component of the velocity. The dust was treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We considered 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5m-sized neutral, spherical dust grains. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 M\u2299 and explore the effects of different initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes.Results. Our study underlines mechanisms for the early transport of dust from the inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of two transient gas motions, namely meridional flow and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust, while the thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Notably, these phenomena occur regardless of the initial cloud core mass, size, and rotation rate.Conclusions. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to the outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.",
"The unique characteristics of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) serve as a link in the evolutionary continuum between galaxies such as the Milky Way and the more massive brightest cluster galaxies found in dense clusters. This research investigates the evolution of the stellar properties of BGGs over cosmic time (z\u2004=\u20040.08\u2005\u2212\u20051.30), extending the work from our prior studies. We analyzed the data of 246 BGGs selected from our X-ray galaxy group catalog within the COSMOS field, examining stellar age, mass, star-formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and halo mass. We compared observations with the Millennium and Magneticum simulations. Additionally, we investigated whether stellar properties vary with the projected offset from the X-ray peak or the hosting halo center. We evaluated the accuracy of SED-derived stellar ages using a mock galaxy catalog, finding a mean absolute error of around 1 Gyr. Interestingly, the observed BGG age distributions exhibit a bias toward younger intermediate ages compared to both semi-analytical models and the Magneticum simulation. Our analysis of stellar age versus mass unveils intriguing trends with a positive slope, hinting at complex evolutionary pathways across redshifts. We observed a negative correlation between stellar age and SFR across all redshift ranges. We employed a cosmic time dependent main sequence framework to identify star forming BGGs and find that approximately 20% of BGGs in the local universe continue to exhibit characteristics typical of star forming galaxies, with this proportion increasing to 50% at z\u2004=\u20041.0. Our findings support an inside-out formation scenario for BGGs, where older stellar populations reside near the X-ray peak and younger populations at larger offsets indicate ongoing star-formation. The observed distribution of stellar ages, particularly for lower-mass BGGs in the range of 1010\u221211\u2006M\u2299, deviates from the constant ages predicted by the models across all stellar mass ranges and redshifts. This discrepancy aligns with the current models\u2019 known limitations in accurately capturing galaxies\u2019 complex star-formation histories.",
"Icy bodies with subsurface oceans are a prime target for astrobiology investigations, with an increasing number of scientists participating in the planning, development, and realization of space missions to these worlds. Within Germany, the Ocean Worlds and Icy Moons working group of the German Astrobiology Society provides an invaluable platform for scientists and engineers from universities and other organizations with a passion for icy ocean worlds to share knowledge and start collaborations. We here present an overview about astrobiology research activities related to icy ocean worlds conducted either in Germany or in strong collaboration with scientists in Germany. With recent developments, Germany offers itself as a partner to contribute to icy ocean world missions.",
"Aims.We present the first release of Turin-SyCAT, a multifrequency catalog of Seyfert galaxies.Methods.We selected Seyfert galaxies considering criteria based on radio, infrared, and optical properties and starting from sources belonging to hard X-ray catalogs and surveys. We visually inspected optical spectra available for all selected sources. We adopted homogeneous and stringent criteria in the source selection aiming at reducing the possible contamination from other source classes.Results.Our final catalog includes 351 Seyfert galaxies distinguished in 233 type 1 and 118 type 2. Type 1 Seyfert galaxies appear to have mid-IR colors similar to blazars, but are distinguished from them by their radio-loudness. Additionally, Seyfert 2 galaxies have mid-IR colors more similar to quasars than BL Lac objects. As expected from their spectral properties, type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies show a clear distinction when using theu\u2005\u2212\u2005rcolor. Finally, we found a tight correlation between the mid-IR fluxes at both 12 and 22 \u03bcm (i.e.,F12andF22, respectively) and hard X-ray fluxes between 15 and 150 keV. Both Seyfert types appear to follow the same trend and share similar values of the ratios ofF12andF22toFHXin agreement with expectations of the AGN unification scenario.Conclusions.As future perspectives, the Turin-SyCAT will then be used to search for heavily obscured Seyfert galaxies among unidentified hard X-ray sources, given the correlation between mid-IR and hard X-rays, and to investigate their large-scale environments."
